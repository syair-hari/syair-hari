<p>Beyond their reputation as a bad omen, there’s a lot to know about these birds. Birds have feathers, wings, lay eggs and are warm blooded. I like learning new things. Born in bulgaria, i have lived in places like germany, belgium and iraq, before settling down with my family in luxembourg. And we like birds and animals very much.</p>

<p>To know even more about these peculiar animals, we want to tell you some interesting facts about woodpeckers. I like animals of all kinds. (9 cm) long and flies every year from alaska to mexico, a round trip of 3,800 miles (6,400 km). Birds are bipedal animals, which means they have two feet and can stand, walk, and run. Birds are vertebrate animals adapted for flight.</p>
