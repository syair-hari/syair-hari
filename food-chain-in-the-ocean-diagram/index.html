For example, grass produces its own food from sunlight. From the food chain, we get to know how organisms are connected with each other. In the ocean, a food chain typically starts with energy from the sun powering phytoplankton, and follows a course such as: Each step of the food web or chain is called a trophic level.</p>

<p>The diagram below shows an example of an ecological pyramid for the ocean. I created cards that were 9 to a page and 4 to page and the first page includes the entire food chain that we came up with so you have the answers right there. Food webs are built from food chains.all forms of life in the sea have the potential to become food for another life form. From the food chain, we get to know how organisms are connected with each other. A food chain is not the same as a food web.</p>

<p>Shrimplike creatures eat the diatoms. You can think of a food chain like an actual chain. An ocean food chain shows how energy is passed from one organism, living thing, to another in the ocean. Each of these creatures occupies a unique position on the food web, or trophic web, which is composed of producers, consumers, and decomposers. The diagram below shows an example of an ecological pyramid for the ocean.</p>
