Marine organisms have adapted to the great diversity of habitats and distinctive environmental conditions in the marine environment.adaptations are many and varied but they are generally grouped into 3 main categories: Surviving in this frigid realm of intermittent food supply poses difficulties all of its own. Ask students to predict how different ocean habitats might affect the animal adaptations seen there. Some ocean animals spend most of their life in the waters near the land.</p>

In this article, let’s explore top seven tropical rainforest animal adaptations: The open ocean biome is home to a wide range of animals, ranging in size from microorganisms that can only be seen with microscopes to mammoth blue whales that can be up to 110 feet long. The ocean depth ranges from shallow waters near coastlines to the mariana trench which plunges 35,797 feet below the ocean’s surface.
