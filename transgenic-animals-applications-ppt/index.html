These are animals that have had their dna manipulated to express an additional (foreign) gene. The main principle in the production of transgenic animals is the introduction of a foreign gene or genes into an animal (the inserted genes are called transgenes).the foreign genes must be transmitted through the germ line, so that every cell, including germ cells, of the animal contains the same modified genetic material 18. Human mutant genes are inserted into mice and other animals, causing them to suffer from human diseases.</p>
