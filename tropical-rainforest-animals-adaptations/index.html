In the tropical rainforest, geckos are green which provides camouflage in treetops where they dwell. Bengal tigers have a few unique adaptations that make them suitable predators in tropical rainforests. Interestingly, this region is hugely oozing with biodiversity as it contains more than half of the world’s plant and animal species.</p>

The rainforest soil does not have very many nutrients like the soil in other parts of the world. Animal adaptations many animals have adapted to the unique conditions of the tropical rainforests. Adaptations can include such traits as narrow leaves, waxy surfaces, sharp spines and specialized root systems. Explore the layers of the rainforest here.
