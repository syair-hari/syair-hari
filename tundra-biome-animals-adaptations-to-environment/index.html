<p><strong>Tundra Biome Animals Adaptations To Environment</strong>. Many different plants and animals can have the same adaptation for surviving the same. Tundra is a biome where low temperatures and short growing seasons result in sparse tree cover on land. Due to the harsh conditions of the tundra biome, there are only certain animals that can survive in this environment. In arctic and alpine tundras, the number of species of plants and animals is usually small when compared with other regions, yet the number of individuals per species is often high.</p>
