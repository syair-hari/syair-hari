<p>Likewise, “biological machines” also require well engineered parts and good energy source in order to work.perhaps the second most important molecule (dna is the first) is adenosine triphosphate (also known as atp).basically, atp serves as the main energy currency of the cell. With a net gain of 2 atp only in the previous stage, that is ‘glycolysis’, there is the need to harvest more energy. It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from food. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are two processes that enable efficient cellular functioning which in turn enables. This type of respiration is most common in higher organisms. Cellular respiration is the process of oxidizing food molecules, like glucose, to carbon dioxide and water.</p>

<p>Cellular respiration is the process of oxidizing food molecules, like glucose, to carbon dioxide and water. Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert chemical energy from oxygen molecules or nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (atp), and then release waste products. During aerobic respiration, catabolic reactions convert larger complex organic molecules into atp, the chemical that drives most physiological processes in the body.in other words, respiration is the key way that a cell gets chemical. The stages of cellular respiration include glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation, the citric acid or krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. This process takes place in the mitochondria of a cell.</p>

<p>And to some degree, both answers would be correct. The respiration can be aerobic, which uses glucose and oxygen, or anaerobic which uses only. Cellular respiration is the process through which cells convert sugars into energy. This releases the energy stored in the bonds of glucose. In this process, molecules of water and carbon dioxide are released as waste products.</p>

<p>But to just see how it fits together is that the process of cellular respiration, it does produce energy directly. Extracting those nutrients necessary to keep us going and then converting them into useable energy is the job of our cells.this complex yet efficient metabolic process, called cellular respiration, converts the energy derived from sugars, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into adenosine triphosphate, or atp, a high. Cellular respiration is a set of biochemical reactions that takes place in most cells. Cellular respiration can be summarized as glucose + oxygen= carbon dioxide + water + atp (energy) cellular respiration in plants. Describe in your own words what cell respiration is and why it is needed.</p>

<p>This is where the process of cellular respiration takes over. This series of reactions produces 36 molecules of atp! Cellular respiration is the process of oxidizing food molecules, like glucose, to carbon dioxide and water. So if i were to break down this energy portion of cellular respiration right there, some of it would just be heat. This type of respiration is common in most of the plants and animals, birds, humans, and other mammals.</p>
