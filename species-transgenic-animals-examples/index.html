<p>It is synthesized by transgenic carrot cells grown in tissue culture. The introduction of transgenic plants into agriculture has been vigorously opposed by some. The ability to introduce foreign genes into the germ line and the successful expression of the inserted gene in the organism have allowed the genetic manipulation of animals on an unprecedented scale. Examples of transgenic species • salmon with bovine growth hormones that grows faster and produces more meat • potato plants with pea genes that enhance the potato’s resistance The information gained from the use of the transgenic technology is relevant to almost any aspect of modern biology including developmental gene regulation, the action of oncogenes, the immune. One common theme evident from these studies is the complex, multistep nature of all stages of brca progression from initiation to metastasis.</p>

<p>Transgenic organisms modern genetic technology can be used to modify the genomes of living organisms. Other animals include pig, goat, cow, sheep, fish etc. These animals should eventually prove to be valuable sources of proteins for human therapy. First transgenic animal was a ‘supermouse’ created by ralph brinster (u pennsylvania) and richard palmiter (university of washington) in 1982. Inserting a foreign gene to animals will be done successfully when the gene was inherited by the offspring.</p>

<p>Transgenic animals are unable to breed new individuals with their genome. The offspring was much larger than the parents. This process is also known as “genetic engineering.” genes of one species can be modified, or genes can be transplanted from one species to another. Transgenic animals are the animals with genome that was changed in order to bring genes coming from other species. The main principle in the production of transgenic animals is the introduction of a foreign gene or genes into an animal (the inserted genes are called transgenes).the foreign genes must be transmitted through the germ line, so that every cell, including germ cells, of the animal contains the same modified genetic material 18.</p>

A transgenic fish is one that contains genes from another species. These animals should eventually prove to be valuable sources of proteins for human therapy. It is synthesized by transgenic carrot cells grown in tissue culture. Following are the examples of transgenic animals.</p>

<p>Transgenic means that one or more dna sequences from another species have been introduced by artificial means. Mehendale, in encyclopedia of toxicology (third edition), 2014. A transgenic animal is one whose genome has been altered by the transfer of a gene or genes from another species or breed. The vast majority of genetically modified animals are at the research stage while the number close to entering the market remains small. The offspring was much larger than the parents.</p>

<p>Recombinant dna methodology is used to construct the gene that is intended to express desirable qualities during the growth and development of the recipient animal. Transgenic animals are unable to breed new individuals with their genome. The evolutionary development of multicellular organisms. The offspring was much larger than the parents. However, hybrids are always sterile , unable to breed new individuals with their genome.</p>
