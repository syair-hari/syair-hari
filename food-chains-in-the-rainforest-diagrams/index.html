<p>All living things need energy for growth and health. Within a food chain, some living things create the energy (producers) and some use the energy (consumers).plants are producers of energy, as they make their own food (using sunlight, soil, and other elements).; Food chains, food webs, and energy pyramids can be helpful tools for understanding how the living things in an ecosystem depend on each other for the matter and energy they need to grow and perform daily activities. A food chain in a grassland ecosystem may consist of grasses and other plants, grasshoppers, frogs, snakes and hawks (figure 8.3). Some animals eat plants, some animals eat other animals.</p>

<p>A food chain differs from a food web, because the complex network of different animals' feeding relations are aggregated and the chain only follows a direct, linear pathway of one animal at a time. Linked to the topics of animals and all living things, it includes a matching activity, a game and a simulation of a food web. An animated sequence that illustrates and explores food chains. Animals are consumers, because they have to eat other animals. Food chain is a linear sequence of organisms which starts from producer organisms and ends with decomposer species.</p>

<p>Within a food chain, some living things create the energy (producers) and some use the energy (consumers).plants are producers of energy, as they make their own food (using sunlight, soil, and other elements).; Producers, who make their own food using photosynthesis or chemosynthesis, make up the bottom of the trophic pyramid. Students can use this printable to learn about the basics of the food chain. Examples of these in the amazon rainforest are the macaws, monkeys, agouti, sloths and toucans. A food chain in a grassland ecosystem may consist of grasses and other plants, grasshoppers, frogs, snakes and hawks (figure 8.3).</p>
