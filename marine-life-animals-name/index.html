<p>Some species are present only incidentally or are pest species. Unfortunately, it’s not uncommon for marine life to mistake plastic pellets for food. Rottnest island is an a class reserve. Six species of sea turtles come to the reef to breed and 30 species of whales, dolphins and porpoises have been recorded there. Cephalopods, crustaceans, &amp; other shellfish.</p>

<p>To demonstrate how an organism is classified, let us use the classification of the commonly named “ the blue whale ”. If a fish has the word devil in its name, it's a safe bet that it's going to be freaky. In the final week, we focus on fish. Banded butterflyfish — this is a kind of fish that lives in coral reefs in the western atlantic ocean and has beautiful black and white bands on it.; When describing life forms (i like to call all life forms 'critters'), especially marine life forms, the name may be easy or it may be difficult.</p>

<p>When describing life forms (i like to call all life forms 'critters'), especially marine life forms, the name may be easy or it may be difficult. When we talk about marine life, the first thing that is likely to come to your mind is various species of fish. From fishes to sharks and whales to crabs and octopuses to microscopic algae, marine wildlife is highly diverse and contains the highest amount of life on earth. Others are kept to serve a functional role such as consuming algae in the aquarium. More than 1,500 fish species, 17 species of sea snake and at least 330 species of ascidians live on the reef.</p>

<p>Marine life of rottnest island. Others are kept to serve a functional role such as consuming algae in the aquarium. From sharks and sea turtles to ecosystems and corals, you’re in the right place to take a deep dive into life under the sea. At 3.5 pounds, the species has a larger brain than humans. Therefore the marine producers are always in the upper layers of the ocean, the area we call the photic zone.</p>
