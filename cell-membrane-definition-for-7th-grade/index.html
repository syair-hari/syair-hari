<p>It is also referred to as the plasma membrane. Rachel ryland from boston collegiate charter school. The cell membrane plays an important role in regulating the entry and exit of specific substances within the cell. The cell membrane controls what materials come into and out of a cell. The cell membrane is the semipermeable membrane of a cell that surrounds and encloses its contents of cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. The cell membrane consists of a lipid bilayer, including cholesterols that sit between phospholipids to maintain their fluidity at various temperatures.</p>

In cells that have a cell wall the cell membrane is the second layer. By structure, it is a porous membrane (with pores) which permit the movement of selective substances in and out of the cell. Animal cells don't have cell walls, but they do have cell membranes, which help control which substances are allowed to enter and exit a cell.

<p>A cell membrane is a fluid, flexible barrier on the outside of a cell that protects it. In plant cells, the membrane encapsulates the protoplasm. The cell membrane is the outside layer that separates the cell from the outside. In this unit on cell theory and cell structure and functions, 7th grade students will be able to recognize the different levels of organization in plants and animals including cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, and organisms (7.12c).

<p>In the human body, food we have digested reacts with oxygen in the mitochondria to make energy for the cell. In cells without cell walls, the membrane forms the outside boundary that separates the cell from its environment. The nucleus of animal cells is bound by a membrane. It allows some substances in and keeps others out. The cell membrane is the outer edge of the cell and forms the boundary between the inside of the cell with all of its organelles and the extracellular matrix.</p>

<p>Images obtained through electron micrography reveal the bilayer structure of cell membranes. It allows some substances in and keeps others out. It is a feature of all cells, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic. The cell membrane, which is thin and can be easily seen on the outside of animal cells, controls what can come in and what can go out of the cell. In cells with cell walls, the cell membrane is located just inside the cell wall.</p>

<p>In the human body, food we have digested reacts with oxygen in the mitochondria to make energy for the cell. It moves constantly and supports organelles. The cell membrane is the outer edge of the cell and forms the boundary between the inside of the cell with all of its organelles and the extracellular matrix. The cell membrane, also known as the plasma membrane, is a double layer of lipids and proteins that surrounds a cell.it separates the cytoplasm (the contents of the cell) from the external environment. The unit starts off by defining cells, and looking at how cells interact with their environments through cellular trans…</p>
