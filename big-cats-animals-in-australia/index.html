<p>Although my sympathies very obviously lie on the feline side, i recognise that feral cats in australia represent a very big (pun. Mr townsend said the partnership with ford will allow them to track the movements of the animals in finer detail. To take over as director of the big cat sanctuary in kent. However, there is an expanded definition of big cats that includes the cheetah, snow leopard, cougar (mountain lion/puma), clouded leopard and sunda clouded leopard. An unnatural history of panthers has turned up some surprising information.</p>

<p>Locals in northern victoria shoot dead. Historical records date the introduction of cats to australia at around 1804 and that cats first became feral around sydney by 1820. An unnatural history of panthers has turned up some surprising information. In the us, there are an untold number of big cats in captivity. These animals are known as abcs or alien big cats.</p>

<p>In the early 1900s, concern was expressed at the pervasiveness of the cat problem. Sightings, tracks and predation have been reported in a number of countries and states including canada, britain, australia, germany, france, spain, ireland, new zealand, finland, denmark, the united states, hawaii, italy and luxembourg. With sightings in australia so widespread, and reaching back so many years, perhaps alien big cats aren’t so alien to the australian bush after all. The second theory was that big cats arrived in australia with international military personnel as mascots, and when the australian government told the defence forces to get rid of exotic animals. Another is that big cats escaped from zoos or circuses.</p>
