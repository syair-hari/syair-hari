<p>The conservation institute notes that there are a few common elements that tie many tundra animals together, such as heat retention in the body, trapped air insulation, fat insulation and oil that keeps moisture at bay. They are usually seen with their bottom up at the top of the water and their head beneath it. At the moment i am doing a powerpoint on a tundra, and it asks what animals are in your biome. Those are the areas where the temperatures are extremely low for most of the year, the sunlight is also scarce, and the soil is hardened due to permafrost. Food and feeder relationships are simple, and they are more subject to upset if a critical species disappears or decreases in number.</p>

<p>The caribou are also a thriving animal in the tundra. Many different plants and animals can have the same adaptation for surviving the same. Though the tundra is remote, it is increasingly threatened as people encroach on it to build or drill for oil, for example. Many tundra animals, such as musk ox, have a thick, fur coat that has two layers of fur.

<p>There are two particular adaptations that help the lemming survive. Food and feeder relationships are simple, and they are more subject to upset if a critical species disappears or decreases in number. Lemmings have a lot of fur which protects and insulates them from the harsh weather. Arctic tundra, antarctic tundra, and alpine tundra. Chinchillas are crepuscular alpine tundra animals that inhabit the andes mountains in south america.</p>
