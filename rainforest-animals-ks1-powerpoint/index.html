I've used this resource for different purposes. The australian free tree frog is just one of the many animals that live at daintree rainforest. Despite only occupying 0.1% of australia, the region is home to 90% of the country’s bat and butterfly. Rainforest habitats are full of amazing plants and animals!</p>
