<p>Both north and south carolina follow the ada, which permits the use of service animals in public areas and public housing. However, emotional support animals and service animals are not given the same protection laws, under the ada. If the dog has been trained to sense that an anxiety attack is about to happen and take a specific action to help avoid the attack or lessen its impact, that would qualify as a service animal. Service animals are working animals, not pets. Under the ada, owners of public accommodations are not required to allow emotional support animals, only service animals.</p>
