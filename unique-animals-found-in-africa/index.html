<p>Here is a very brief list of characteristics and introduction of grassland animals. Above we’ve looked at the most iconic african animals found on the savanna, but there are plenty more we didn’t cover. Apart from south africa, tsessebe is also found in angola, botswana, namibia, zimbabwe, zambia, and swaziland. They have a flat skull.

<p>They inhabit in savannah woodlands and rocky hillsides. The species was only discovered in the 19th.

They can be found solely in congo, and they are endangered mostly due to hunting and habitat loss. The okapi is a relative of giraffes, the only one in existence.</p>
