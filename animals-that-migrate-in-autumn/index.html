<p>Here is a list of 10 animals that hibernate. Because temperatures begin to drop during the fall season, these creatures begin to find more suitable conditions. Other migratory creatures include whales and dolphins, bats, butterflies and fish. More than 20 million may gather in a single cave. Like we explored with our animal habitat project, animals either adapt to their surroundings or need to make a temporary move.</p>

<p>You might mistake these tiny creatures for a baby squirrel. Some species travel here for the winter and others arrive in spring and summer. Like we explored with our animal habitat project, animals either adapt to their surroundings or need to make a temporary move. Vote for your favorite photo or submit your own if you've got one! Then they return to their earlier homes.</p>
