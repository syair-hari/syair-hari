<p>Animals such as chameleons and some frogs have long sticky tongues to catch prey. The shape of an animalâs teeth tells us what kind of food it eats. Cow, deer, horse, giraffe, squirrel, and butterfly are examples of herbivores. This is the reason why you see them mostly in australia and asia and animals like tasmanian devil and wolf converted themselves to meat eaters. Canine teeth are long and pointed, such as the ones you see when a lion or tiger roars.</p>

<p>Cow, deer, horse, giraffe, squirrel, and butterfly are examples of herbivores. Herbivores like cow, horse, and goat have wide, blunt teeth. Usually, such animals cannot digest meat. Such as rabbits, cats and humans. These animals have fewer molars for chewing.</p>
