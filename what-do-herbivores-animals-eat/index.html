<p>Some animals are frugivores because they eat mainly fruit. Herbivores depend on plants for their survival. Being a herbivore is opposed to other diet descriptions such as fungivores which explicitly eat fungi, carnivores which explicitly eat meat or detritivores which eat dead cell matter. As an evolutionary response to this problem, many leaf eaters, or herbivores, have developed a pouch at the anterior. Herbivores have teeth that are adapted to grind vegetable tissue. Herbivores only eat things that need photosynthesis to live.</p>

They require sufficient energy to survive. Some examples of polygastric ruminant herbivores include cows, goats, giraffes, sheep and deer.</p>

<p>The hen, the bear and the pig are onmivores because they eat meat and leaves. Elephants need to eat about 130 kilograms (300 pounds) of food a day. What animals eat carnivores, herbivores &amp; omnivores. Organisms that can produce their own food, such as through light, water, or chemicals like carbon dioxide. • could the animals in food group 3 depend only on plants if animals were not available?</p>
