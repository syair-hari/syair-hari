Cellular respiration occurs in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, with most reactions taking place in the cytoplasm of prokaryotes and in the mitochondria of eukaryotes. The location of cellular respiration. During aerobic respiration, catabolic reactions convert larger complex organic molecules into atp, the chemical that drives most physiological processes in the body.in other words, respiration is the key way that a cell gets chemical.</p>

<p>Cellular respiration is the process by which the living organismâs cells extract the energy stored in the chemical bonds of food molecules , especially sugars ( glucose ) that are manufactured by the plants or eaten by animals , then this energy is stored in the f orm of atp molecules to be use d in performing the different activities. Cellular respiration takes place in the cells of animals, plants, and fungi, and also in algae and other protists. If you are searching for information on the formula of cellular respiration equation, the following biologywise article will prove to be useful. There are three main stages of cellular respiration: Cellular (aerobic) respiration takes place in the presence of and with the use of a certain element.</p>

<p>Glucose(c 6 h 12 o 6) + oxygen(6o 2) â carbon dioxide(6co 2) + water(6h 2 o)+ energy (atp) Cellular respiration occurs in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, with most reactions taking place in the cytoplasm of prokaryotes and in the mitochondria of eukaryotes. Have a look at the reaction which takes place during aerobic respiration. Cellular respiration takes place in the cells of animals, plants, and fungi, and also in algae and other protists. Cellular respiration takes place in both the cytosol and mitochondria of cells.</p>
