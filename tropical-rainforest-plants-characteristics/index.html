<p>A related plant type, the hemiepiphyte, begins life in the canopy and grows long roots that eventually reach the forest floor. The diversity of the rainforest biome is huge, so that almost all kinds of plants are represented in rainforests. It is common for them to get at least 100 inches per year. Rainforest ecosystems as a whole can be divided into tropical rainforests and temperate rainforests. The forest floor is usually completely shaded because no light is bale to come through because of the thick trees above.</p>

<p>This biome experiences no dry season and has rich biodiversity. An additional plant type characteristic of the canopy system is the liana—a sort of woody vine that begins life as a shrub on the forest floor and makes its way up to the canopy by latching on to canopy trees. In tropical rainforests, many plants live as epiphytes to receive the necessary sunlight and moisture to complete their life cycle. Small scale farming, commercial logging, cattle farming and commercial agriculture. Tropical rainforests have distinct characteristics that support a wide variety of different species.</p>
