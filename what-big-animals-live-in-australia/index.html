The stars of the show are the area’s resident big cats, but you’ll also see antelopes, hyenas, warthogs, hippos, along with several species of birds and other animals. The echidna has sharp spine like a big porcupine and one of the surviving members of the monotreme species.</p>

<p>This spiky animal is australia’s most widespread mammal, occurring from snowy peaks to dusty deserts. So when australia’s live export industry turned to vietnam as a major customer, there was always a high risk the same would happen to australian animals exported to the region — even though our live export rules are supposed to prevent such abuse. Sharks, crocodiles, jellyfish, stingrays… there’s no shortage of scary animals swimming around australia’s waterways, but the sea lion isn’t one of them. Thanks to the mother nature, the continent is isolated from the rest of the world, making it a unique place with animals that are rare in other parts of the world.
