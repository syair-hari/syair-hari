<p>Examples of these in the amazon rainforest are the jaguar and the boa constrictor. For example, if all of the ants in the rainforest died then everything that eats the ant would be hungry. Each link in a food chain is important. The tropical rainforest biome is the flora and fauna that make up the ecosystem. Birds of the tropical rain forest are known for their bright color, such as parrots, macaws and toucans.</p>

<p>Decomposers or detrivores also are part of this food chain. A food chain tells you which animals rely on other animals for food. Some estimates say that between 50 and 75% of all plants, animals, and organisms are indigenous to rainforests. Children may need to use their own research skills to check if their interpretation of the food chain is accurate before recording it on the table. Many food chains may be joined together to form a food web.</p>
