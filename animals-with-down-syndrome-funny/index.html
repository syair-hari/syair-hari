<p>It’s nice to think that in 2019, we’ve come a long way as a society and it seems that now more than ever, people are less judgemental and a lot more understanding of disabilities. Maybe they just didn’t understand that any child needs parents who care for them. 20 animals with down’s syndrome who are utterly beautiful! Some of us have the extra chromosome 21 in our cells and you dont know maybe if he was inbred he could have been born with down syndrome cause he could have be born with the extra chromosome 21. I have a cat who is mentally disabled.</p>

<p>Pin on animals with down syndrome. It’s nice to think that in 2019, we’ve come a long way as a society and it seems that now more than ever, people are less judgemental and a lot more understanding of disabilities. While it is not exactly the same disease as down syndrome, it can leave the animal with similar visual and mental characteristics. Some animals have the same physical problems as a human. They also have some degree of intellectual disability.</p>
