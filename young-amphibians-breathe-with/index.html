<p>One of the most popular reptiles in the world are crocodiles. Their skin has to stay wet in order for them to absorb oxygen so they secrete mucous to keep their skin moist (if they get too dry, they cannot breathe and will die). Amphibians are considered vertebrates as they have a backbone. The pulsing throat movements pull air into the lungs through the nostrils before it is forced out by the frog’s body contractions. Adult amphibians are lacking or have a reduced diaphragm, so breathing via lungs is forced.</p>
