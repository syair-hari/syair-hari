<p><strong>Food Chain Definition Simple</strong>. A food chain shows what eats what in a particular habitat. A succession of organisms in an ecological community that are linked to each other through the transfer of energy and nutrients, beginning with an autotrophic organism such as a plant and continuing with each organism being consumed by one higher in the chain. A food chain shows how this energy flow occurs. All organisms need energy to live.</p>

<p>Food chain definition, a series of organisms interrelated in their feeding habits, the smallest being fed upon by a larger one, which in turn feeds a still larger one, etc. The graphic chain who feeds on who in nature.” This lesson will define what a food chain represents, go through specific examples of food chains, and compare and contrast a food chain with a food. The food chain is a series of living things which are linked to each other because each. Each animal is a link in a food chain. Plants are at the bottom of a food chain because they are producers that make their food from a process called photosynthesis.</p>

Food chain definition, a series of organisms interrelated in their feeding habits, the smallest being fed upon by a larger one, which in turn feeds a still larger one, etc. It starts with the primary source, like the sun or hydrothermal vents, where producers make food, continues with consumers, or animals who eat the food, and ends with the top predator. Each link in this chain is food for the next link. This is because they produce their own food! A food chain shows what eats what in a particular habitat.</p>

<p>A food chain in a grassland ecosystem may consist of grasses and other plants, grasshoppers, frogs, snakes and hawks (figure 8.3). Energy is not created or destroyed. Consumers eat producers and get their energy from them. Energy is obtained from food. For this particular food chain, the grass is the producer.</p>

<p>The food chain can be defined as; Some animals eat plants and some animals eat other animals. An arrangement of the organisms of an ecological community according to the order of predation in which each uses the next usually lower member as a food source.

<p>The term food chain refers to the sequence of events in an ecosystem, where one organism eats another and then is eaten by another organism. An arrangement of the organisms of an ecological community according to the order of predation in which each uses the next usually lower member as a food source. For this particular food chain, the grass is the producer. For example, grass produces its own food from sunlight. In a community which has producers, consumers, and decomposers, the energy flows in a specific pathway.</p>

<p>What is a food chain? This lesson will define what a food chain represents, go through specific examples of food chains, and compare and contrast a food chain with a food. A hierarchy based on power or importance at the top of the corporate food chain. Food chains intertwine locally into a food web because most organisms consume more than one type of animal or plant. In the example, grass seeds are eaten.</p>

<p>For this particular food chain, the grass is the producer. A food web can be composed of multiple food chains, some that can be very short, while others may be much longer. Food chain, in ecology, the sequence of transfers of matter and energy in the form of food from organism to organism. Every ecosystem , or community of living things, has one or more food chains. Food chains follow the flow of energy as it moves through the food chain.</p>

<p>For example, a simple food chain links the trees &amp; shrubs, the giraffes (that eat trees &amp; shrubs), and the lions (that eat the giraffes). The above is a simple food chain where a barn owl is at the top. In scientific terms, a food chain is a chronological pathway or an order that shows the flow of energy from one organism to the other. A food chain describes the feeding relationships of different organisms in a linear fashion. Then the rabbits are eaten by foxes.</p>

<p>The lion eats the zebra, which eats the grass. Then the rabbits are eaten by foxes. A food web can be composed of multiple food chains, some that can be very short, while others may be much longer. Plants are at the bottom of a food chain because they are producers that make their food from a process called photosynthesis. A simple food chain could start with grass, which is eaten by rabbits.</p>
