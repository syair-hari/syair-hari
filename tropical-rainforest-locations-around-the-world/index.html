<p>Tropical rainforests are found closer to the equator where it is warm. The tropical rainforest contains far more species of plants and animals than any other biome. However, the specifics of the origin of rainforests remain uncertain due to an incomplete fossil record. The amazon is home to the greatest variety of plants and animals on earth. Rainforest destinations are one of the best places to visit to see an astounding level of animals and plants.</p>

<p>Fragmented rainforests are also located in kenya and tanzania. These forest types form a mosaic of vegetation types which contribute to the incredible diversity of the tropics. The amazon rainforest is currently the largest tropical rainforest biome in the world. There are montane rainforests found in uganda, rwanda, burundi and tanzania. Temperate rainforests are found near the cooler coastal areas further north or south of the equator.</p>

<p>East africa’s rainforests are more fragmented than the continent’s more famous western and central rainforests. Mongabay is the world's most popular source for information on tropical forests. The amazon is home to the greatest variety of plants and animals on earth. A tropical rainforest typically has several layers, such as the emergent, canopy, understory, and forest floor, each with different types of plants and animals adapted for life in that particular area. Tropical rainforests are the most biologically diverse terrestrial ecosystems in the world.</p>
