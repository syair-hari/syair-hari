<p><strong>Cellular Respiration Equation And Photosynthesis</strong>. The cellular respiration equation is a part of metabolic pathway that breaks down complex carbohydrates. Plants utilize water and carbon dioxide to convert the energy from the sun into energy they can use, and they give off oxygen and glucose as a result of this process. Sunlight is changed into the chemical energy of sugars and other organic compounds. Photosynthesis is an anabolic process, whereas cellular respiration is a catabolic process.</p>

<p>Besides the organisms that rely on sulfur near hydrothermal vents, the majority of life on earth relies on the sugar glucose. Apart from plants, cellular respiration also takes place in animals and is the process through which energy is released from organic compounds. Photosynthesis is an anabolic process, whereas cellular respiration is a catabolic process. In photosynthesis, what plants need is light energy (from the sun), carbon dioxide, and water. In addition to glucose, this reaction produces oxygen that is released by the plants into the atmosphere. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are two cellular processes that occur in organisms in order to produce energy.</p>
<h3 id="products-of-photosynthesis-and-respiration">Products of photosynthesis and respiration.</h3><p>Energy + carbon dioxide + water = glucose and oxygen. Can occur only in presence of sunlight: Photosynthesis and cellular respiration both utilize carbon dioxide and water to produce carbohydrates. Explain the how the process of photosynthesis and cellular respiration cycle matter. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are in many respects the “reverse” of one another. That's because respiration is the exact opposite as photosynthesis with one small difference.</p>

<p>The relationship between photosynthesis and cellular respiration is such that the products of one system are the reactants of the other. Cellular respiration does not require light energy, and photosynthesis does. Photosynthesis utilizes energy to metabolize carbohydrates while cellular respiration builds carbohydrates. To create atp and other forms of energy to power cellular reactions, cells require fuel and an electron acceptor which drives the chemical process of turning energy into a useable form.

<p>Plants utilize water and carbon dioxide to convert the energy from the sun into energy they can use, and they give off oxygen and glucose as a result of this process. (atp) through cellular respiration, as explained on the estrella mountain community college photosynthesis web page, to provide energy. Equation of photosynthesis is c6h12o6 + 6o2 ~&gt; 6co2 + 6h2o and equation of respiration is 6co2 + 6h2o ~&gt; c6h12o6 + 6o2. The chemical equation for photosynthesis involves the input (reactants) of carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to produce the outputs (products) of glucose and oxygen. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are two cellular processes that occur in organisms in order to produce energy.</p>

<p>The cellular respiration equation is a part of metabolic pathway that breaks down complex carbohydrates. Every machine needs specific parts and fuel in order to function. Cellular respiration is the reverse of the photosynthesis formula. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are in many respects the “reverse” of one another. Cellular respiration is the process through which cells convert sugars into energy.</p>
