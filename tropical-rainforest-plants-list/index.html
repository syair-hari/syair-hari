<p>The tropical rainforests of the world are some of the most diverse ecosystems you can find with complex relationships between the micro and macro world giving the rainforest the ability to support seemingly abundant life. Because of its strategic location, the amazon rainforest is naturally a home to the world’s unique and most diverse plant and animal species.
