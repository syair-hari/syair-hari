<p>This clip shows all the exciting things that happen during this season. Autumn because they grow on all the dead leaves that have fallen from the trees. But starlings that breed in eastern europe, where winter is much colder, migrate to the uk in winter. In autumn, why not set up a designated haven in your garden to help hibernating animals? This helps lessen the risk of animals looking for hibernation spots in awkward or dangerous places for them.</p>

<p>Many mammals, birds, fishes, insects, and other animals move from one place to another at certain times of the year. Hibernation is the theme for the third programme in this year's series of autumnwatch. This helps lessen the risk of animals looking for hibernation spots in awkward or dangerous places for them. In north america they migrate each spring to the northern coast where they birth their calves in the summer. White pelicans migrate further south to north east africa.</p>
