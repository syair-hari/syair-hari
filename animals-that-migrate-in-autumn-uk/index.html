<p>This clip shows all the exciting things that happen during this season. Autumn because they grow on all the dead leaves that have fallen from the trees. But starlings that breed in eastern europe, where winter is much colder, migrate to the uk in winter. In autumn, why not set up a designated haven in your garden to help hibernating animals?
