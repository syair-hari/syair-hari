<p>A herbivore is an animal anatomically and physiologically adapted to eating plant material, for example foliage or marine algae, for the main component of its diet. An animal’s diet determines where it falls on the food chain, a sequence of organisms that provide energy and nutrients for other organisms.each food chain consists of several trophic levels, which describe an organism’s role in energy transfer in an ecosystem. This excludes insects, spiders, fish and other animals. The animals who eat only meat are known as carnivores. Carnivores eat other animals 12.</p>
