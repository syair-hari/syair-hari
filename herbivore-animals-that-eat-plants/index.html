An animalâs diet determines where it falls on the food chain, a sequence of organisms that provide energy and nutrients for other organisms.each food chain consists of several trophic levels, which describe an organismâs role in energy transfer in an ecosystem. This excludes insects, spiders, fish and other animals. The animals who eat only meat are known as carnivores. Carnivores eat other animals 12.</p>
