<p><strong>Cell Membrane Structure And Function</strong>. The cell membrane separates the cell from the surrounding interstitial fluid, the main component of the extracellular fluid. Plasma membranes separate the cell from its environment while other membranes define the boundaries of organelles and provide a matrix upon which complex chemical reactions can occur. Like all other cellular membranes, the plasma membrane consists of both lipids and proteins. Membranes are lipid structures that separate the contents of the compartment they surround from its environment.</p>

<p>Generally, the cell is formed of 2 major components: The cell membrane is made up of two layers that are composed of phospholipids. The membrane also contains membrane proteins, including integral proteins that go across the In 1972 two scientists s.j singer and cl nicolson proposed fluid mosaic model explaining the structure of the cell membrane. The main functions of the cell membrane include:</p>
