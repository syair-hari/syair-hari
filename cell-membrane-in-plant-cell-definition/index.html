<p>A cell is the structural, functional and biological unit of all organisms. In bacterial and plant cells, a cell wall is attached to the plasma membrane on its outside surface. It is a selectively permeable cell organelle,allowing certain substances inside the cell while preventing others to pass through and thus is analogous to a barrier or gatekeeper in their function. The membrane that surrounds the cell and separates it from the outside environment is called cell membrane.in animals the plasma membrane is the outermost covering of the cell whereas in plants, fungi, and some bacteria. However, they have some apparent differences.</p>

<p>A 3d diagram of the cell membrane. Its function is to protect the integrity of the interior of the cell by allowing certain substances into the cell while keeping other substances out. Cell membrane is the second layer in plant cell present below the cell wall while in animal cell it is the first layer. This organelle is also referred to as plasma membrane. It is made up of proteins and lipids and often contains molecular receptors.</p>

<p>The semipermeable membrane that encloses the cytoplasm of a cell. The membrane that surrounds the cell and separates it from the outside environment is called cell membrane.in animals the plasma membrane is the outermost covering of the cell whereas in plants, fungi, and some bacteria. Cell membrane, also called plasma membrane, thin membrane that surrounds every living cell, delimiting the cell from the environment around it. The thin membrane that forms the outer surface of the protoplasm of a cell and regulates the passage of materials in and out of the cell. Its function is to protect the integrity of the interior of the cell by allowing certain substances into the cell while keeping other substances out.</p>

<p>The cell membrane, also known as the plasma membrane, is a double layer of lipids and proteins that surrounds a cell.it separates the cytoplasm (the contents of the cell) from the external environment. Their characteristic cell wall is composed of cellulose, and they contain chloroplasts for photosynthesis. A 3d diagram of the cell membrane. The cell membrane, also called the plasma membrane, is found in all cells and separates the interior of the cell from the outside environment. Plant cell wall is a tough layer which is made up of cellulose, glycoproteins, lignin, pectin, and hemicellulose located outside the cell membrane.</p>
