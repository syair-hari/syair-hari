<p>Animal migration animal migration is the traveling of long distances in search of a new habitat. Some winged insects such as locusts and certain butterflies and dragonflies with strong flight migrate long distances. A lot of animals will migrate south or to another part of the world when winter approaches. Like many creatures, humpback whales migrate long distances for feeding and mating purposes. They may be navigating by the stars, much as early human sailors did.</p>
