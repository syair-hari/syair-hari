<p>For animals, their “spirit” seems to be merely an animating force rather than an eternal soul (job 12:10). Watch and tell us what you think in the comments!

Animals were not created in the likeness of god as men are. — depends, of course, on how we define “soul.” ancient and medieval writers, both pagan and christian, often used terms that we translate as “soul” (greek psyche, latin anima) to refer in general to that part of an animate (living) creature which sets it apart from inanimate.

<p>In another book, body &amp; soul, he argues (not at length) that we have good reason to think animals have conscious mental states. If animals did have souls then either they are all going to live in eternity with christ as none have them has ever done anything wrong, in that they do not know the difference between good and evil and just live by instinct.

<p>What evidence do we have, both scientifically and spiritually, that animals have souls? Pope francis sent ripples around the world wednesday when he suggested that pets and other animals have a place in heaven, which is in stark contradiction to conservative catholic teaching that animals don't have souls. God saves every animal after death, believers say, so not only do pets and the people who love them enjoy miracles of reuniting (as imagined in the famous poem the rainbow bridge) but wild animals and others who didn't have. The soul is the principle of life. They are like family to me.</p>

All animals including humans have soul and our soul goes through different life forms until we purify it to become one with god. islam the general view is that animals do have souls. Opinions differ on what happens to them on judgement day.</p>

<p>He said animals have souls, just not “immortal” souls, which he “knew” only humans have. So no i don’t think animals have souls. In psalm 104 we read that animals look to god for their food and that when he withdraws his spirit, they return to the dust. God marks the dropping of every sparrow. They are like family to me.</p>

<p>The answer is yes to both questions, say afterlife experts and scholars of religious texts like the bible. He is the author of seven books and dozens of articles, and is a contributing writer for the “christian research journal”. My question is do animals have souls. Simply material souls cease to exist when the body dies, while spiritual and hybrid souls are immortal. The answers are in scripture.</p>
