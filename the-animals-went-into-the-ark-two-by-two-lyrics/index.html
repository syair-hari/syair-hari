<p>The animals went in two by two, the elephant and the kangaroo and they all went into the ark, for to get out of the rain. The animals went in three by three, hurrah! The animals went in three by three, hurrah! The animals went in three by three, the wasp, the ant and the bumble bee and they all went into the ark, for to get out of the rain. The animals went in two by two, hurrah!</p>

<p>An easy way for children to remember the lyrics, and a paper saver! The animals went in three by three hoorah! The animals went in three by three, the wasp, the ant and the bumble bee. The cuneiform wedges were pressed into babylonian ark tablet a full millennium before the genesis narrative was written down, but the two bear a strong thematic resemblance in their treatment of the animals. After the foundation was laid, he hewed the timber and the ark was made.</p>
