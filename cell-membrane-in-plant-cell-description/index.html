<p>This additional layer which surrounds the cell membrane is necessary for offering the requisite protection to the plants. The description and function of the cell membrane is something we all have to learn eventually. The cell membrane is a thin membrane that encases the cytoplasm of the cell, and holds the cytoplasm (as well as the cell’s organelles) within it, separating the interior of the cell from the outside environment. The cell membrane, also known as the plasma membrane, is a double layer of lipids and proteins that surrounds a cell.

<p>In all cells, the cell membrane separates the cytoplasm inside the cell from its surroundings. It separates the cytoplasm (the contents of the cell) from the external environment. As is the case with animal cells, the cell membrane in plants is a lipid bilayer. It is a selectively permeable cell organelle,allowing certain substances inside the cell while preventing others to pass through and thus is analogous to a barrier or gatekeeper in their function. Cells are the basic building blocks of life and without a cell membrane they could not survive.</p>

<p>Function of the cell membrane All cells are contained by a cell membrane that keeps the pieces inside. A cell membrane is a fluid, flexible barrier on the outside of a cell that protects it. The cell membrane separates the cell from the surrounding interstitial fluid, the main component of the extracellular fluid. In an animal cell, the cell membrane functions by providing shape and protects the inner contents of the cell.</p>

<p>In plant cells, the cell membrane is surrounded by a rigid cell wall. A cell membrane physically separates the contents of the cell from the outside environment, but in plants, fungi and some bacteria, there is a cell wall that surrounds this membrane. In plant cells, the cell membrane is surrounded by a rigid cell wall. Cholesterol is found in animal cell membranes, while in plant cell membranes, its function is replaced by sterols. In an animal cell, the cell membrane functions by providing shape and protects the inner contents of the cell.</p>

<p>The cell membrane, also called the plasma membrane, is a thin layer that surrounds the cytoplasm of all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, including plant and animal cells. Cell membrane, thin membrane that surrounds every living cell. Made of lipids and proteins surrounds the cell function: Cell membranes have dynamic and asymmetric properties. Its basic job is to separate the inside of cells from the outside.</p>

<p>The cell membrane is a thin membrane that encases the cytoplasm of the cell, and holds the cytoplasm (as well as the cell’s organelles) within it, separating the interior of the cell from the outside environment. However, the cell wall acts as a solid mechanical support only. They share many common features, such as a cell membrane, nucleus, mitochondria, golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, and more. In all cells, the cell membrane separates the cytoplasm inside the cell from its surroundings. In an animal cell, the cell membrane functions by providing shape and protects the inner contents of the cell.</p>
