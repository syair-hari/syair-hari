Carnivores are meat eating creatures which either hunt or scavenge dead animals, while omnivores are creatures that can consume both meat and plants, making them more versatile compared to herbivores or carnivores. Herbivory is a form of consumption in which a heterotrophic organism consumes other organisms, principally autotrophs [page needed] such as plants, algae and photosynthesizing bacteria.more generally, organisms that feed on autotrophs in general are known as 1st level consumers</p>
