As such the use of These stem cells are capable of regenerating tissue after injury. Order to develop knockout or transgenic animals that are used in research. The cells that retain their proliferative capacity throughout life are regarded as stem cells. The main principle in the production of transgenic animals is the introduction of a foreign gene or genes into an animal (the inserted genes are called transgenes).the foreign genes must be transmitted through the germ line, so that every cell, including germ cells, of the animal contains the same modified genetic material 18.</p>

<p>This section outlines animal welfare concerns which are likely to arise in the creation of transgenic animals and their maintenance in the laboratory setting. Integrated genes can interact with background genes and environmental factors, in part as a function of site of integration, so each transgenic animal can be considered a unique resource. Such animals are most commonly created by the microinjection of dna into the pronuclei of a fertilised egg which is subsequently implanted into the oviduct of a pseudopregnant surrogate mother. Theoretically, all living beings can be genetically manipulated. Consideration will also have to be given to developments which involve species to be held outside the confines of the laboratory.</p>

<p>In general, these animals are produced so that the genetic alterations are stably transmitted to the progeny through the germ line. Methods for producing transgenic animals: Consideration will also have to be given to developments which involve species to be held outside the confines of the laboratory. Environment, maintenance of genetic diversity and overall improvement in animals welfare. Products derived from the mammary glands of transgenic goats and sheep have progressed through advanced clinical trials and have been approved by regulatory bodies [9, 10].</p>

<p>Animals have been used in studies and research for. The production of transgenic animals has focused mainly on producing models (e.g., the mouse) for basic and medical research. Currently, the cost of generating a transgenic pig is about us $20,000 and that of a transgenic cow is around us $250,000 (kind and schnieke 2008). Read this article to learn about the maintenance, characterization and applications of stem cell cultures. Order to develop knockout or transgenic animals that are used in research.</p>
