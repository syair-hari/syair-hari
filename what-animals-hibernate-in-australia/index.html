<p>Some aboriginal groups in this area have an oral history of the burrunjor, a “giant lizard” that ate kangaroos. While the northern ground squirrels spend the summer eating and preparing for winter hibernation, ground squirrels living in the southwest desert may avoid the extreme summer heat by aestivating in their burrows. Migratory species listed under international agreements to which australia is a party are protected under the australian government's central piece of environmental legislation, the environment protection and biodiversity conservation act 1999 (epbc act). North american desert animals like tortoises, crocodiles, frogs, and salamanders go through the aestivation cycle. Almost all australian animals do not hibernate.</p>

<p>Bears living in cold climates hibernate when the food is scarce, but the bears in warmer climates can find plenty of food all year long so they have no reason to hibernate. This is not surprising given that australia is full of lizards, some quite large. Some animals hibernate (go into a deep sleep) so they can survive throughout the cold season when the weather is freezing and the food is scarce. Almost all australian animals do not hibernate. Early humans evolved in equatorial africa and didn’t need to escape harsh weather conditions or were not likely to have experienced a shortage of food.</p>
