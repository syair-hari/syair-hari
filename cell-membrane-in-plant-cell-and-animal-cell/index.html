<p>In plants, the cell membrane is located between the cell cytoplasm and the cell wall. The plant cell has a cell wall, while the animal cell does not. The study of cells is called cell biology, cellular biology, or cytology. A difference between plant cells and animal cells is that most animal cells are round whereas most plant cells are rectangular.plant cells have a rigid cell wall that surrounds the cell membrane. The cell membrane in a plant cell basically does the same as an animal cell's plant membrane, so it's a layer of protection, and it allows objects to pass through it. A cell is a tiny structure, which cannot be seen with naked eyes.</p>
<h3 id="plant-cells-are-eukaryotic-cells-that-differ-in-several-key-aspects-from-the-cells-of-other-eukaryotic-organisms">Plant cells are eukaryotic cells that differ in several key aspects from the cells of other eukaryotic organisms.</h3><p>An animal cell is the fundamental functional unit of life of animals.it is also the basic unit of reproduction. The function of a cell membrane is to protect the cell from its surrounding. Both plant and animal cells contain nucleus along with similar organelles. Cell membrane is the second layer in plant cell present below the cell wall while in animal cell it is the first layer. Animal cells do not have a cell wall but have a cell membrane. Therefore, even though both animal and plant cells have vacuoles, they have a lot of differences.</p>

The cell membrane in a plant cell basically does the same as an animal cell's plant membrane, so it's a layer of protection, and it allows objects to pass through it. It is a selectively permeable cell organelle,allowing certain substances inside the cell while preventing others to pass through and thus is analogous to a barrier or gatekeeper in their function.

An animal cell is the fundamental functional unit of life of animals.it is also the basic unit of reproduction. Robert hooke, an english natural philosopher, was the first to describe microscopic pores, which he later called cells, albeit from samples of a plant cork. Organisms are usually made up of one or several cells. The cell wall guards and maintains the cell shape and provides rigidity to the cell.</p>

<p>As is the case with animal cells, the cell membrane in plants is a lipid bilayer. But few organelles are unique to the plant cell as well as the animal cell. The membrane is a thin and fragile structure, usually between 5 to 10 nm (nanometer) wide that separate cells from the surrounding environment. Cells consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane, which contains many biomolecules such as. Cell membrane is present in all organisms including plants.</p>

<p>The membrane also contains membrane proteins, including integral proteins that go across the The plant cell has a cell wall, while the animal cell does not. The cell (from latin cella, meaning small room) is the basic structural, functional, and biological unit of all known organisms.a cell is the smallest unit of life. No living cells on earth one finds without plasma membrane; The cell wall is, a rigid membrane matrix found on the surface of all plant cells whose primary role is to protect the cell and its content.</p>

<p>The function of a cell membrane is to protect the cell from its surrounding. Centrioles—help to organize the assembly of microtubules. Animal cells were first observed in the 17th century when microscopy was invented. In addition to a cell membrane, plants have cell walls made out of tough compounds called cellulose and lignin, which makes them rigid and tough — useful for keeping trees from collapsing into gelatinous piles of plant tissue. In 1972 two scientists s.j singer and cl nicolson proposed fluid mosaic model explaining the structure of the cell membrane.</p>
