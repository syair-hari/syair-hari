According to the bible john 17:17 and not according to traditional religious creed at genesis 2:7 it says man came to be a living soul,not had a soul. The general view is that animals do have souls. I regularly teach an intensive course in philosophy at the international baptist theological seminary in prague.</p>

<p>During an interview for the denver post, animal behaviorist marc bekoff, professor emeritus at the university of colorado, boulder, said “if we have souls, our animals have souls. The “dust from the ground” and “the breath of life.”. This may be a dumb question. Importantly, this has a direct bearing on the question of whether humans and other living creatures have souls. 7:15, 22) have the breath of life and their own type of souls.</p>

<p>However, we can use general biblical principles to develop some clarity on the subject. Jonathan edwards, announced findings related to his research into the female soul early this week. In many passages, god shows compassion for the beast or bird, whether by the law, or other means. Lesser in that as sad as it felt being told as a young person, animals do not have souls. I grew up in baptist churches most of my life, but have attended several different denominations.</p>

<p>This after he was formed from the dust # 1 then given the breath of life from god jehovah's holy. Is there any truth to this? Lesser in that as sad as it felt being told as a young person, animals do not have souls. In psalm 104 we read that animals look to god for their food and that when he withdraws his spirit, they return to the dust. Animals do not have spirit.</p>
