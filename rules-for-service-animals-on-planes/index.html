<p>Airlines can require that service dogs to be leashed at all times, and they can bar dogs that show aggressive behavior. Department of transportation said this week that it is finalizing a rule specifying that. Airlines can require people with a service dog to turn in paperwork up to 48 hours before a flight, but they can’t bar those travelers from checking in online like other passengers.

Individual airlines, including delta and alaska airlines, have tightened their rules for transporting service and support animals, and at least 22 states already have laws addressing the issue.</p>
