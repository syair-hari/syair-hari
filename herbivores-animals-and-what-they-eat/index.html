<p><strong>Herbivores Animals And What They Eat</strong>. Some animals eat only meat. Just like cows, they’re ruminants, have a similar digestive system and four stomachs. Howler monkeys, fruit bats, and blue and yellow macaw are some of the herbivores that live in the amazon rain forest. Herbivores play an important role in the food chain since they provide food for secondary consumers in the food web (carnivores).</p>

<p>Herbivores have teeth that are adapted to grind vegetable tissue. They mainly eat grass, roots, branches, and bark. The diets of herbivorous animals varies based on climate, geographic location, and time of year. The ecosystem must always be in a position to provide enough food to sustain herbivores animals and continue with the processes of the food chain. Cows, horses, goats and deer are the examples of herbivores. Plant food is sometimes low in nutrients (substances that the body needs for energy, growth, and to stay healthy).</p>

Some animals eat only plants. Carnivores, organisms that consume animals, and omnivores, organisms that consume both plants and animals, are the third trophic level. Animals that eat plants are called herbivores. Other animals survive on a diet of plants, fruits and vegetables, these are called herbivores. Plant food is sometimes low in nutrients (substances that the body needs for energy, growth, and to stay healthy).</p>

<p>However, many herbivores will eat eggs and occasionally other animal protein. A herbivore is an animal anatomically and physiologically adapted to eating plant material, for example foliage or marine algae, for the main component of its diet. Their sharp front teeth help them to cut grass and their flat grinding teeth at the back help them to chew the grass. An herbivore is an animal that eats only plants and no meat.

<p>Some animals are frugivores because they eat mainly fruit. Animals fall into three distinct groups based upon what they eat. Horses and other herbivores have wide flat teeth that are adapted to grinding grass, tree bark, and other tough plant material. The herbivores that feed on fruits are known as frugivores while folivores are herbivores that feed on leaves. This group also includes granivores (animals that eat mainly seeds) and folivores (animals that eat mainly foliage).</p>

<p>Herbivory is a form of consumption in which a heterotrophic organism consumes other organisms, principally autotrophs [page needed] such as plants, algae and photosynthesizing bacteria.more generally, organisms that feed on autotrophs in general are known as 1st level consumers They are found somewhere in the middle of the food chain. They include large animals, like elephants and horses, but also smaller animals, like rabbits. Herbivorous animals are those who survive on plants, fruits, leaves, and other natural food sources. The herbivores whose main source of energy is plant foods.</p>

A large percentage of herbivores have mutualistic gut flora that help them digest plant matter, Many animals that eat fruit and leaves sometimes eat other parts of plants, for example roots and seeds.

<p>But some herbivorous animals will eat eggs and occasionally other animal protein. These rodents are also herbivores. Browsers eat mostly leaves and sometimes small tree branches.

<p>Because plant matter is often difficult to break down, the molars of herbivores are wider and flatter, designed to grind food, and aid in digestion. Many animals that eat fruit and leaves sometimes eat other parts of plants, for example roots and seeds. A herbivore is an animal anatomically and physiologically adapted to eating plant material, for example foliage or marine algae, for the main component of its diet. Animals that eat plants are called herbivores. Then comes the omnivorous animals that eat almost everything that they found available to feed.</p>

<p>Carnivores sit one step above herbivorous animals in the food chain as they feed on other animals. Giraffes, elephants, zebras, horses, cows, deer, rabbits.herbivores survive on leaves, shrubs, grass, weeds. Because plant matter is often difficult to break down, the molars of herbivores are wider and flatter, designed to grind food, and aid in digestion. That would be almost all of them… at least, among vertebrates.

<p>As a result of their plant diet, herbivorous animals typically have mouthparts adapted to rasping or grinding. This group also includes granivores (animals that eat mainly seeds) and folivores (animals that eat mainly foliage). This science powerpoint is great for teaching children about animals, including humans, and what they eat.the slides introduce key vocabulary to do with animals' diets: Carnivores are animals that eat other animals.
