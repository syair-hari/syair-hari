Have students observe and record the behavior of animals (insects, spiders, birds, amphibians, mammals, etc.) in their yards and see how they interact with the plants there. The adaptation of animals and plants to their environment is a series of varied biological processes with varying purposes, but the general purpose is the continued survival of the species. Mycorrhizae are associations between fungi and the roots of a plant. As the ant plant invites ants to live in it in order to get nitrogen, so the pitchers invite animals to die in them.</p>
