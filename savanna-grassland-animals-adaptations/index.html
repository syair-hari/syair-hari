<p>It is home to an amazing variety of wildlife. This allows the cheetah to camouflage easily in the brown grasslands of the savanna while stalking its prey. This has lead to most evolving energy saving methods such as having a 'high' stamina or only being active or more active when it is cool or night time in the case of many animals in the savanna. The savanna is characterized by its variety of grasses. Temperate grasslands are home to many large and small herbivores.</p>
