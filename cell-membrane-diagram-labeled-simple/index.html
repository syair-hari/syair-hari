The diagram, like the one above, will include labels of the major parts of an animal cell including the cell membrane, nucleus, ribosomes, mitochondria, vesicles, and cytosol. It is a feature of all cells, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic. The cell membrane is a multifaceted membrane that envelopes a cell's cytoplasm. Cell membrane is made of proteins and lipids making it easy for the cell for exchange of matter with other cells.</p>

<p>It is a living membrane, outermost in animal cells but internal to cell wall in plant cells. Cell membrane is made of 4 kinds of molecules namely phospholipids, carbohydrates, proteins and cholesterol. The plasma membrane is a protective barrier that surrounds the interior of the cell. It regulates the exchange of substances in and out of the cell. The cell membrane is a multifaceted membrane that envelopes a cell's cytoplasm.</p>

<p>The cell membrane plays an important role in regulating the entry and exit of specific substances within the cell. Diagram of the cell (plasma) membrane. Though this animal cell diagram is not representative of any one particular type of cell, it provides insight into the primary organelles and the intricate internal structure of most animal cells. It is composed of a thin layer of protein and fat. It is essentially the “bag” that holds all of the intracellular material and regulates the movement of materials into and out of the cell.</p>
