Down syndrome is a genetic disorder caused when abnormal cell division results in an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21. Down syndrome or down's syndrome, also known as trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. Instead, the condition became called down's syndrome. in the 1970s, an american revision of scientific terms changed it simply to down syndrome, while it still is called down's in the uk and some places in europe. We also provide services to schools, health professionals and other professionals who want to learn more about down syndrome.</p>
