<p>Never buy animals from pet shops unwilling to spend time with you making sure you understand the commitment being taken on. From bunnies to chinchillas, to hamsters and gerbil, these little animals are perfect for every family. I have two hermit crabs, and i know they're not that cuddly but they're not aggressive and fast, so you can hold them for a while. Smaller pets can be great if your family isn't quite ready for the commitment of a larger pet like a dog or cat. Again, if you have small children, perhaps a rabbit is a better option.</p>

<p>The animals that are the lowest maintenance that is the most affectionate include bombay cats, golden retrievers, hedgehogs, chinchillas, i love to cuddle and i love animals. Ferrets can grow very cuddly as they get older, usually at 3. Never buy animals from pet shops unwilling to spend time with you making sure you understand the commitment being taken on. You can start off small and expand your aquarium or pond into a vibrant community of animals, that can form a lifelong passion for fish. Still, this pet shares an excellent bond with humans.</p>
