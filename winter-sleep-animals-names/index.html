Let children point out animals that sleep for all or part of the winter and other animals that migrate to warmer places during winter. The winter boy names are very popular across the globe. See photos of winter wildlife from national geographic’s photo ark. You might mistake these tiny creatures for a baby squirrel.</p>

<p>Baby boy names that mean winter, snow or ice. The season of christmas spreads happiness everywhere, just like your little one. Some animals hibernate (go into a deep sleep) so they can survive throughout the cold season when the weather is freezing and the food is scarce. This is the case for squirrels, beavers, skunks, badgers, and raccoons. Let children point out animals that sleep for all or part of the winter and other animals that migrate to warmer places during winter.</p>
