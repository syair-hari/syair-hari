<p>The intricacies of the tropical rainforest food web are incredibly diverse and interesting if you look closely at how the rainforest plants and animals sustain each other. Decomposers are important members of the food chain in the amazon rainforest. A primary consumer, or herbivore, eats only plants. Examples of these in the amazon rainforest are jaguars, gorillas and anacondas. Levels in a tropical rainforest food chain the simplest way to think about it is that there are four levels in the tropical rainforest food chain (there are actually often more):</p>
