<p>Consumer effects on rainforest primary production are often considered negligible because herbivores and macrodetritivores usually consume a small fraction of annual plant and litter production, even though consumers are known to have effects on plant production and composition in nontropical systems. The amazon rainforest is the world’s largest tropical rainforest. It is home to around 40,000 plant species, nearly 1,300 bird species, 3,000 types of fish, 427 species of mammals, and 2.5 million different insects. Gorillas eat leaves, shoots, stems, roots and bark. But some herbivorous animals will eat eggs and occasionally other animal.</p>

<p>There is a wide range of herbivore living in the rainforest. Asian elephants, like their african counterparts, eat prodigious amounts of vegetation to sustain their large bodies. There are even many herbivores in the list of wild animals that only lives in amazon. The predatory animals of the rainforest include poisonous snakes and carnivorous mammals. The temperate rainforest biome is relatively sparse and restricted to a few regions of north and south america, asia, and australia.</p>

Rainforests account for only about 6 percent of the total land area on the planet but more than half of the world’s species live there! Herbivores and omnivores that live in tropical rain forests include the african forest elephant, sumatran rhinoceros, chimpanzee, golden lion tamarin and linn's sloth.
