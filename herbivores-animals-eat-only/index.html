<p>They require sufficient energy to survive. They feed specifically on plants. Herbivores have special digestive tracts that are designed to handle different types of plants they might eat. Some herbivores, such as caterpillars, eat only one kind of plant, while others, such as elephants, eat the shoots, flowers, fruits, and leaves of a wide variety of plants. These animals depend on other animals for their diet. Animals can be put into groups based on the types of food they eat.</p>

On the other hand, some are not that selective and eat almost every.</p>
