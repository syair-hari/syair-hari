<p>They require sufficient energy to survive. They feed specifically on plants. Herbivores have special digestive tracts that are designed to handle different types of plants they might eat. Some herbivores, such as caterpillars, eat only one kind of plant, while others, such as elephants, eat the shoots, flowers, fruits, and leaves of a wide variety of plants. These animals depend on other animals for their diet. Animals can be put into groups based on the types of food they eat.</p>

<p>Any animal that eats only plants will be classified as an herbivore. While these animals only consume plants, their diet definitely varies from one to another. Due to a herbivore's ability to survive solely on tough and fibrous plant matter, they are termed the primary. Herbivores are those animals, such as deer and koalas, that only eat plant material. On the other hand, some are not that selective and eat almost every.</p>
