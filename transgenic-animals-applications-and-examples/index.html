<p>Animals engineered to be susceptible to human viruses, by introduction of viral receptors or other host range determinants, can also be used for testing human vaccines. The major types of transgenic animals are listed, with examples of each. A transgenic animal is one that carries a foreign gene that has been deliberately inserted into its genome. The main principle in the production of transgenic animals is the introduction of a foreign gene or genes into an animal (the inserted genes are called transgenes).the foreign genes must be transmitted through the germ line, so that every cell, including germ cells, of the animal contains the same modified genetic material 18. Animal biotechnology is the use of science and engineering to modify living organisms. Theoretically, all living beings can be genetically manipulated.</p>
