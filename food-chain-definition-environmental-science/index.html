For food, a sustainable system might be seen as encompassing a range of issues such as security of the supply of food, health, safety, affordability, quality, a strong food industry in terms of jobs and growth and, at the same time, environmental sustainability, in terms of issues such as climate change, biodiversity, water and soil quality. A food chain is a connection of links, but the links are plants and animals that.

<p>Explain what a food chain is. Introduction, definition and branches of ecology. A food chain is a linear network of links in a food web starting from producer organisms (such as grass or trees which use radiation from the sun to make their food) and ending at apex predator species (like grizzly bears or killer whales), detritivores (like earthworms or woodlice), or decomposer species (such as fungi or bacteria).a food chain also shows how the organisms are related with. This is the simplest way of showing feeding relationships. Food chains intertwine locally into a food web because most organisms consume more than one type of animal or plant.</p>

<p>The classification of producer can also be used for organisms that create their own food. Both pathways are important in accounting for the energy budget of the ecosystem. A food chain describes a single pathway that energy and nutrients may follow in an ecosystem. In our example above, there is more grass than zebras, and more zebras than lions. How food chains and food webs represent the flow of energy and matter.</p>

<p>The population of species in a food chain is shown using a pyramid of numbers. The term food chain describes the order in which organisms, or living things , depend on each other for food. Food chain and web carbon cycle oxygen cycle water cycle nitrogen cycle environmental issues human activities have created many environmental issues from land, water, and air pollution. In a typical food chain, plants are eaten by herbivores, which are then eaten by carnivores. In our example above, there is more grass than zebras, and more zebras than lions.</p>
