<p>These iconic australia animals are marsupials, a kind of mammal that is born undeveloped and is carried in a pouch. Other birds such as kookaburras are the world's largest kingfishers. The creatures roam the land on their own or in packs of up to 10, and each one weighs just 22 to 33 pounds. The thing is, mini donkeys like company and they can’t stand loneliness. So while australia is a country where every native species will probably kill you, japan seems like a country where every native species looks like it wants a hug.</p>
