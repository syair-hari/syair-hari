<p>To be expressed correctly by the cells of the host. Not all of the complete genetic material is initially transferred, only one or several genes, which have been previously; Write briefly any three benefits of such transgenic of such transgenic animals to human beings. Transgenic sheep and goats have been produced that express foreign proteins in their milk. Gordon and ruddle first used the term “transgenic” in 1981 to describe an animal in which a foreign dna segment (a transgene) was incorporated into their genome. The simplest type of transgenic animals are those which have genetic material inserted into their own code for research purposes.</p>

These are animals that have been genetically modified through the introduction of foreign dna or rna. The key difference between gmo and transgenic organism is that gmo is an organism that has an artificially altered genome, while the transgenic organism is a gmo that has an altered genome containing a dna sequence or gene from a different species. When there were not technologies like biotechnology or genetic engineering, the farmers would breed their animals selectively for the increased.</p>

As such, transgenic animals were recognized as specific variants of species following the introduction and/or integration of a new gene or genes into the genome. In gene transfer, animals carrying new genes (integrating foreign dna segments into their genome) are referred to as transgenic, a term first coined by gordon and ruddle (1981).</p>

<p>The main principle in the production of transgenic animals is the introduction of a foreign gene or genes into an animal (the inserted genes are called transgenes).the foreign genes must be transmitted through the germ line, so that every cell, including germ cells, of the animal contains the same modified genetic material 18. Transgenic animals overproduce, underproduce, lack production of, or have modified expression of a. Ruddle (1981), there has been rapid development in the use of genetically engineered animals as investigators have found an increasing number of applications for the technology. Recombinant dna technology is used for this purpose. Genetically modified organisms that have had foreign dna inserted into their genome are said to.</p>

<p>Since 1981, when the term transgenic was first used by j.w. The foreign gene is constructed using recombinant dna methodology. Much recent research has concentrated on engineering ti plasmids to contain other genes that are also transferred to the host plants during infection, creating transgenic plants.

<p>Transgenic or genetically modified organisms are those species which have foreign genes in their genetic makeup to show certain characteristics. Transgenic or genetically modified organisms are those species which have foreign genes in their genetic makeup to show certain characteristics. The transgenic animals are those which have (a) foreign dna in some of its cells (b) foreign dna in all of its cells (c) foreign rna in all of its cells (d) dna and rna both in the cells. Giant mouse has been produced through (a) gene transfer (b) gene differentiation (c) tissue culture (d) all of these. Transgenic animals are animals (most commonly mice) that have had a foreign gene deliberately inserted into their genome.</p>

<p>The production of pharmaceuticals using transgenic animals is called _____ _____ gene pharming. Both types of organisms have an altered genome. A foreign gene is inserted into these animals to see certain characteristics for batter. Ruddle (1981), there has been rapid development in the use of genetically engineered animals as investigators have found an increasing number of applications for the technology. These are animals that have been genetically modified through the introduction of foreign dna or rna.</p>

<p>Transgenic animals what are transgenic animals? The foreign gene is constructed using recombinant dna methodology. The transgenic animals are those which have b) foreign dna in all its cells •transgenic organisms are the organisms that have their genome altered. The foreign gene is constructed using recombinant dna methodology. Transgenic sheep and goats have been produced that express foreign proteins in their milk.</p>

<p>Recombinant dna methodology is used to construct the gene that is intended to express desirable qualities during the growth and development of the recipient animal. The transgenic animals are those which have (a) foreign dna in some of its cells (b) foreign dna in all of its cells (c) foreign rna in all of its cel Both types of organisms have an altered genome. Genetically modified animals are animals that have been genetically modified for a variety of purposes including producing drugs, enhancing yields, increasing resistance to disease, etc. The transgenic animals are those which have (a) foreign rna in all its cells (b) foreign dna in some of its cells (c) foreign dna in all its cells (d) both (a) and (c).</p>
