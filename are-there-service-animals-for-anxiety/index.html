<p>Service animals live with individuals with psychological disorders and other disabilities to help them with activities of daily living, such as remembering to take medication or learning to identify the signs of an impending anxiety attack. According to the ada, there is “a distinction between psychiatric service animals and emotional support animals. There has been a continuous, significant rise in depression, anxiety and mental illness in the lives of college students and as colleges and universities have opened back up for the fall semester, a rise in emotional support animals has occurred. Emotional support animals (esas) an emotional support animal (esa) is just what it sounds like—a pet that provides emotional support. Unlike service animals, emotional support animals (esa) are not trained in skills to support a disability.</p>

<p>If the dog has been trained to sense that an anxiety attack is about to happen and take a specific action to help avoid the attack or lessen its impact, that would qualify as a service animal.” If the dog has been trained to sense that an anxiety attack is about to happen and take a specific action to help avoid the attack or lessen its impact, that would qualify as a service animal. The presence of an esa can calm anxiety and allow the individual experiencing anxiety to focus on petting or interacting with it, redirecting his or her thoughts or providing a calming presence during tasks that cause anxiety symptoms. Both pet dogs and service dogs provide an abundance of emotional benefits. Service dogs are trained to help their humans with their specific needs.</p>

<p>There are a number of other treatment options for depression available as well. Additionally, service dogs can perform vital tasks such as retrieving items, alerting others in the event of an emergency, and perhaps most. Animals who are only there to offer comfort or emotional support for sad and other mental illnesses (known as emotional support animals) are not recognized as service animals by the ada. Service dogs can be trained to help relieve anxiety by responding appropriately when they detect it. They also provide unconditional support for individuals with all types of mental health disorders, 24/7 and always free.</p>
