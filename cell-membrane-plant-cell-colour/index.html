<p>A pitcher plant features a deep cavity filled with _____ or digestive liquid secreted through the plant cell membrane. Protective coat in plant cells. Plant cell definition plant cells, which are the fundamental units of the members of the plant kingdom, are eukaryotic cells. All animal and plant cells have cell membranes. A vacuole is surrounded by a membrane called the tonoplast (word origin: When viewed under the microscope, it can be seen that the nucleus &amp; cell organelles are more stained than the cytoplasm, allowing us to see the contents of the cell more clearly.</p>

A cell is the smallest unit of a living organism. Some organisms are unicellular while some are multicellular. Chromoplasts have red, orange and yellow coloured pigments which provide colour to all ripe fruits and flowers.
