These plants also have small waxy leaves to prevent the loss of water in this cold and dry environment. Tundra form in two distinct cold and dry regions. Just as fur traps air and acts as an insulator in animals, hairy outgrowths on plants keeps their temperature more moderate and prevents freezing.</p>

From the lack of lots of vegetation, some herbivores in the tundra have a hard time finding areas with a abundance of plants to eat during the winter. Also, nearly all the tundra's vegetation have adapted in some way to help reinforce the survival of their species. It is also physical adaptations.
