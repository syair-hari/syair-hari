In this process glucose is broken down in the presence of molecular oxygen into six molecules of carbon dioxide, and much of the energy released is preserved by turning adp and free phosphate into atp. The series of metabolic processes by which living cells produce energy through the oxidation of organic substances. Cellular respiration is the process by which cells convert nutrients into the energy that is used to power a variety of functions like transportation, locomotion, and the synthesization of macromolecules.</p>
