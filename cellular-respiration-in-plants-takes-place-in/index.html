<p>Respiration takes place in the mitochondria of the cell in the presence of oxygen, which is called aerobic respiration. Oxygen from the air enters into a leaf through stomata and reaches all the cells by the process of diffusion. Cellular respiration takes place in the cells of animals, plants, and fungi, and also in algae and other protists. Respiration in plants is strikingly similar to why living objects breathe. Then byproducts such as carbon dioxide and water are released and removed from the living objects through breathing, just like plants do when they respire. Glycolysis, the krebs cycle, and electron transport.</p>
<h3 id="respiration-takes-place-in-the-mitochondria-of-the-cell-in-the-presence-of-oxygen-which-is-called-aerobic-respiration">Respiration takes place in the mitochondria of the cell in the presence of oxygen, which is called aerobic respiration.</h3><p>Cellular respiration is the process by which organisms use oxygen to break down food molecules to get chemical energy for cell functions. Some cells respire aerobically, using oxygen, while others undergo anaerobic respiration, without using oxygen. As with photosynthesis, plants get oxygen from the air through the stomata. Aerobic respiration is a type of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen and produces energy. To create atp and other forms of energy that they can use to power their life functions, cells require fuel and an electron acceptor which drives the chemical process of turning energy from that fuel into a useable form. According to hartnell college, cellular respiration takes place in the cytoplasm of cells and inside the mitochondria.</p>

<p>Glycolysis is the first stage of cellular respiration which takes place inside the cytoplasm. This process can be explained with the help of the chemical equation: Plants undergo cellular respiration that involves three stages: Respiration takes place in the mitochondria of the cell in the presence of oxygen, which is called aerobic respiration. In this process of cellular respiration, plants generate glucose molecules through photosynthesis by capturing energy from sunlight and converting it into glucose.</p>

The first stage of cellular respiration, called glycolysis, takes place in the cytoplasm. Atp is used for all cellular activities that require energy. Cellular respiration is the aerobic process by which living cells break down glucose molecules, release energy, and form molecules of atp. • takes place in the cells of all the higher plants and animals • glucose is completely oxidized • the end products are carbon dioxide and water • complete oxidation of one molecule of glucose yields 38 atp molecules • process takes place in both cytoplasm and mitochondria of the cell.</p>

<p>If a plant is transferred from water to salt solution, it’s respiration increases this is known as salt respiration. Atp is important to this process because its energy is required for cellular activity. Cellular respiration is the process by which the living organism’s cells extract the energy stored in the chemical bonds of food molecules , especially sugars ( glucose ) that are manufactured by the plants or eaten by animals , then this energy is stored in the f orm of atp molecules to be use d in performing the different activities. 25) during the second stage of cellular respiration, the _____ takes place in the mitochondria and generates nadh and fadh2.

<p>According to hartnell college, cellular respiration takes place in the cytoplasm of cells and inside the mitochondria. The cellular respiration occurs in the mitochondria. Respiration in plants is strikingly similar to why living objects breathe. The exchange of gases in the leaves during respiration takes place through stomata. As with photosynthesis, plants get oxygen from the air through the stomata.</p>

<p>This process is called glycolysis. Atp is important to this process because its energy is required for cellular activity. The leaves of plants have tiny pores on their surface which are called stomata. • oxygen is not utilized for the process. Dark respiration and photo respiration.</p>
