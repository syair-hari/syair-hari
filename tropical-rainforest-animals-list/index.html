<p>The poison dart frogs live in the tropical rainforest which usually stay near a water source, such as a pond or stream. They weigh less than 5 ounces when fully matured. They are found in central and south america, mostly in the amazon rainforest. The rainforest alliance works hard to protect rainforests and the biodiversity within them through the sustainable management of tropical forests, restoring degraded land surrounding forests, and protecting rivers and streams. Rainforests account for only about 6 percent of the total land area on the planet but more than half of the world’s species live there!</p>
