<p>For the animals from sleeping beauty, see forest animals (sleeping beauty). In this video, you are going to watch the hd videos of 16 real forest animals. Giant panda pandas live mainly in bamboo forests high in the mountains of western china, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. The animals and birds live in their natural environment and some of them fall under the endangered species list due to indiscriminate hunting and poaching. We are going to learn all about different animals and their habitats this week during virtual preschool.</p>
