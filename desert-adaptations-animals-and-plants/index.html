<p><strong>Desert Adaptations Animals And Plants</strong>. The desert adaptations of birds &amp; mammals. Adaptations can include such traits as narrow leaves, waxy surfaces, sharp spines and specialized root systems. Although we normally think of adaptations as a characteristic of animals, plants have adaptations too. Thus, adaptations of desert animals are actually the adjustments to protect themselves against high temperatures, to live without water, and to conserve water as far as possible.</p>

<p>Plants that grow well in desert environments need to store moisture in their fleshy leaves or have an extensive root system. Some plants, such as the desert ironwood (olneya tesota), have leaves with small hairs. Water, so necessary for life processes, is often scarce. These hairs reflect sunlight and block wind movement, both of which reduce evapotranspiration from the leaves. The desert biome poses adverse conditions which requires certain adaptations on the part of desert animals and plants to fulfill their basic needs. Are well adapted to their habitat.</p>

Animals of desert ecosystem are much more affected by extremes of temperature than desert plants because the biological processes of animal tissue function properly within a relatively narrow temperature range. The desert is a dry area with scarcity of waters thus the plants there have small leaves and many spines which help them to conserve water.

<p>Plants found in deserts are well adapted to cope with harsh desert conditions such as water scarcity and scorching heat. Animals and plants live in diverse climatic conditions of deserts (hot and cold), jungles, oceans, etc. When these animals rest in the shade, their enormous ears dissipate the excess heat. In this account, we make a survey of animals that take advantage of harsh desert environments, surviving and even thriving through exceptional physical, behavioral and biochemical adaptations. Adaptations enable indigenous plants and animals not merely to survive here, but to thrive most of the time.</p>

<p>The desert biome is characterized by sandy or stony soil, high temperatures, and little moisture. Desert animal species, like plants, face a tremendous amount of stress because of the extreme temperatures, lack of water, lack of food sources, and predators which are components of these ecosystems [10]. So, animals derive water from desert plants such as cactus. Because of this, animals in these environments have developed both behavioral and physiological adaptations in order to survive [10].

In this account, we make a survey of animals that take advantage of harsh desert environments, surviving and even thriving through exceptional physical, behavioral and biochemical adaptations. Water, so necessary for life processes, is often scarce. Desert plants mainly the cactus group can be developed in nurseries and personal gardens.</p>
