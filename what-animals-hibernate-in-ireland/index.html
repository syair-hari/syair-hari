<p>Your child will learn about adaptability and the diverse nature of the animal kingdom. Hibernation sites are known as hibernacula. Some animals hibernate over the winter, going into a very deep sleep. Your child will gain a better understanding of the natural world as well as knowing what certain animals hibernate during winter and what the reasons are for doing so. During their active period before hibernation hedgehogs build up fat to sustain them for the winter.</p>

<p>The following is a list of 15 animals that hibernate along with their characteristics: Bears are the animals most known for hibernating, but they aren't the only ones. They like to eat worms, snails, beetles, berries and fruit. They settle down in outdoor structures like sheds and farm buildings and enter a dormant state as the weather turns cold. Surprisingly, even normally solitary snakes will create a hibernating mass;</p>

<p>Briefly, hibernation is a way for animals to survive the cold winter months. They hibernate for most of the summer in this nest. Some animals hibernate (go into a deep sleep) so they can survive throughout the cold season when the weather is freezing and the food is scarce. In ireland as in other countries the red squirrel will usually disappear from an area when the grey squirrel species begin to use it as a habitat, as the grey squirrel has the competitive advantage of remaining longer at ground level to forage, the red squirrel’s hoards can be found by the greys and their winter food source can be removed. Hibernation truly is a clever survival mechanism.</p>
