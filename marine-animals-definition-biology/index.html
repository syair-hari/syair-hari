Hybridizations (reproductive biology) the act or process of mating organisms of different varieties or species to create a hybrid (molecular biology) the process of forming a double stranded nucleic acid from joining two complementary strands of dna (or rna) (as in nucleic acid hybridization) supplement hybridization is the process of producing a hybrid. From sharks and sea turtles to ecosystems and corals, you’re in the right place to take a deep dive into life under the sea.
