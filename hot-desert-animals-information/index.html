<p>Most deserts get less than ten inches of precipitation each year and evaporation usually exceeds rainfall. It is one of earth’s major types of ecosystems, supporting a community of plants and animals specially adapted to the harsh environment. The desert biome poses adverse conditions which requires certain adaptations on the part of desert animals and plants to fulfill their basic needs. This is because there are no clouds in the desert sky to keep the heat in at night. The agave plant stores are commonly called water hoarders meaning they store water in their fleshy leaves, stems, or roots.</p>
