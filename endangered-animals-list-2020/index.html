<p>In australia, over 300 species of australian animals are now considered vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered in 2020. While some animals exceed the constraints of time, others continue to make the endangered species list. Despite the best efforts of the endangered species act, the number of animals which have become either critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable has nearly doubled since 2007. Table 7 is currently available as pdf documents only. Of the seven species of sea turtle found in our oceans, two (kemp’s ridley and hawksbill) are critically endangered, one (green) is endangered, and three (loggerhead, olive ridley and leatherback) are vulnerable.</p>
