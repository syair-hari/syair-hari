The list was presented at the world conservation congress in jeju, south korea. As per the iucn red list by the international union for conservation of nature (march 2019), there are 21 animals and birds listed in the categories of critically. The irrawaddy dolphin is classed as endangered by the icun, and it's little wonder.

<p>In australia, over 300 species of australian animals are now considered vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered in 2020. While some animals exceed the constraints of time, others continue to make the endangered species list. Despite the best efforts of the endangered species act, the number of animals which have become either critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable has nearly doubled since 2007. Table 7 is currently available as pdf documents only. Of the seven species of sea turtle found in our oceans, two (kempâs ridley and hawksbill) are critically endangered, one (green) is endangered, and three (loggerhead, olive ridley and leatherback) are vulnerable.</p>
