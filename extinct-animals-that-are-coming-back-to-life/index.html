<p>The point to stress upon here is that the decrease in the activities done by humans around the world, resulted in the increase in the probability of living of these animals. But science offers the hope of bringing some of these species back from extinction by using genes taken from the tissues of dead animals to grow new animals. The aldabra rail first went extinct around 136,000 years ago. So if someone was going to bring back the passenger pigeon, then i think you could justify that. Scientists may take a jurassic park approach to bringing the subspecies back.</p>

<p>Cloning is done by taking saved specimens of dna from the extinct animals and using the most similar species as a surrogate parent. Bringing extinct animals back can help the environment. There are some extinct species — such as the woolly mammoth, shown above — that may be brought back to life if scientists can overcome some practical hurdles and thorny ethical questions. Scientists from around the world have started to develop ways of bringing previously extinct animals back to life. With that said, conservationists being interviewed by the guardian, discuss an unconfirmed sighting of the white dolphin.</p>

Cloning is the most widely proposed method, although genome editing and selective breeding have also been considered. But, due to overfishing, collisions with ships and pollution, it’s believed these mammals are now extinct. Bryan nelson, a freelance writer for mother nature network, states that the baiji dolphin is a potential species for cloning.</p>
