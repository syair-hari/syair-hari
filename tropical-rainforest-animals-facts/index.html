<p>The tropical rainforest of africa was the habitat in which the ancestors of humans evolved, and it is where the nearest surviving human relatives—chimpanzees and gorillas—live still. With current deforestation techniques, a 120 yard section of rainforest is permanently removed every second so that farming or other land. The amazon rainforest is the world’s largest tropical rainforest. They are perfectly adapted to live in the trees. Tropical rainforest facts for kids facts about the tropical rainforest.</p>

<p>Its powerful beak can open hard nuts and seeds. Rainforests are forests that receive a large amount of precipitation, but they don't necessarily have to be warm. Now the list of tropical rainforest animals is undoubtedly lengthier than that of other biomes on the planet, but that doesn't mean we can afford to lose them to incessant deforestation. The tropical rainforest occurs close to the equator and is warm, (usually hot) and rainy year. Rainforests only cover around 2 percent the total surface area of the earth and about 6% of the earth‘s land surface, but about 50 percent of all known species of the plants and animals on the earth live in the rainforest.</p>

<p>The rainforest is waking up. Veiled stinkhorn fungi, found in tropical rainforests, smell like rotting food! Instead, this is what you can expect day. Rainforests nearest to the equator, where the climate is very hot and wet all through the year, are evergreen because the trees can grow all of the time and so are always in leaf. While many people have heard of the amazon rainforest, there is still a lot of information that should be known.</p>
