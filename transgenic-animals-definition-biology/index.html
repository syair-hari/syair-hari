<p><strong>Transgenic Animals Definition Biology</strong>. The main principle in the production of transgenic animals is the introduction of a foreign gene or genes into an animal (the inserted genes are called transgenes).the foreign genes must be transmitted through the germ line, so that every cell, including germ cells, of the animal contains the same modified genetic material 18. Methods for creating transgenic animals To analyze the malfunction of a mutated gene; Let us have a detailed look at the process, importance and applications of transgenic animals.</p>

<p>Foreign genes are inserted into the germ line of the animal, so it can be transmitted to the progeny. By, damaris benny daniel ii msc. Result in a mosaic embryo with normal and transgenic cells. A transgenic animal , for instance, would be an animal that underwent genetic engineering. In addition to the gene itself, the dna usually includes other sequences to enable it to be incorporated into the dna of the host and It allows many copies of the transgenic organism to be produced.</p>

<p>In 1988, a transgenic mouse prone to cancer was first genetically engineered animal to be patented. Transgenesis is the process by which mixing up of genes takes place. The below mentioned article provides a study note on transgenic plants. It allows many copies of the transgenic organism to be produced. Genetically modified animals that arise from the injection of the pronucleus of fertilized eggs are commonly referred to as âtransgenicâ animals.</p>

<p>Dna microinjection, the first technique to prove successful in mammals, was first applied to mice (gordon and ruddle, 1981) and then to various other species such as rats, rabbits, sheep. In addition to the gene itself, the dna usually includes other sequences to enable it to be incorporated into the dna of the host and Transgenic animals are extensively used to study in vivo gene function as well as to model human diseases. Transgenic animals are those that have been genetically modified. Transgenic animals although several recombinant proteins used in medicine are successfully produced in bacteria, some proteins need a eukaryotic animal host for proper processing.</p>

<p>The first genetically modified organism was engineered in the year 1980. The below mentioned article provides a study note on transgenic plants. Transgenic animals although several recombinant proteins used in medicine are successfully produced in bacteria, some proteins need a eukaryotic animal host for proper processing. Translation of transgenic for spanish speakers. The transgenic mice have been genetically modified so that they carry a green fluorescent protein which glows green under blue light.</p>

<p>It allows many copies of the transgenic organism to be produced. Translation of transgenic for spanish speakers. Sheep, goats, pigs, cows, rabbits, rats, mice, fish, insects, parasites and even humans have previously been used in this modification process. An animal that has had a new dna sequence introduced into its germ line by insertion into a fertilized egg or an early embryo. A transgenic animal , for instance, would be an animal that underwent genetic engineering.</p>
