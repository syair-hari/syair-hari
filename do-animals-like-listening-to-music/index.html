<p>What does this say about the evolutionary purpose of music? Like dogs, cows also prefer classical music, and will shockingly produce more milk when they are listening to slow jams (music under 100 beats per minute) and less milk when listening to fast. Throughout centuries, scientists have been contemplating over the fascination of if dogs, cats and other animals actually connect to music, the same way humans do. Do cats like classical music, rap or metal? Still other research showed that birds and humans react in similar ways to music.</p>

<p>Dogs and cats often hear music as noise but may find it pleasent. According to a study from 2001, researchers found that dairy cows that listened to certain types of music produced more milk and were more relaxed.according to the study, music tempo affects the cows' productivity. I put a cd player in their coop and i play music while i work. With jazz and rock, they exhibited stressful behaviors like stamping and head tossing. According to the study, cows find it easy to release oxytocin, which is a hormone that is related to the milking process, when they listen to music.</p>
