<p>Rainforest animals colourful and unusual animals dwell in all four layers of the rainforests. A rainforest is a forest that receives heavy rainfall. The amazon rainforest, alternatively, the amazon jungle, also known in english as amazonia, is a moist broadleaf tropical rainforest in the amazon biome that covers most of the amazon basin of south america. Rainforest facts show that anaconda is the name used for various snake species found in south america, but the biggest among them (and the deadliest) are definitely green anacondas. The axolotl is probably the rarest animal on this list, being restricted to only one or two populations in the rainforest rivers of mexico.the axolotl is native only to lakes and rivers in the valley of mexico.</p>

<p>Many unusual animals and plants have been discovered in rainforests. These tropical rainforest animals feed on tree leaves and buds, fruits, ferns, and fungi. They feed on insects, and lay eggs like most other reptiles. But most of the plant life didnât begin to flourish until after the most recent ice age. Oct 11, 16 10:26 pm</p>
