Temperate rain forests receive more than 100 inches of rain every year. Only a small percentage of the animals live on the forest floor. The rainforest alliance works hard to protect rainforests and the biodiversity within them through the sustainable management of tropical forests, restoring degraded land surrounding forests, and protecting rivers and streams. Watch the video below from 3 mins 40 seconds to discover some of the animal species found in.</p>

<p>Plants in the rainforest have many adaptations that help them survive the climate. Plant adaptations in the tropical rainforest. Grassland animals have adapted to dry and windy climate conditions. The survival of the rainforest is extremely important to the earth due to the functions that it performs. For example, since the rainforest gets so much precipitation, many of the plants have adaptations that help them shed water off their leaves as quickly as possible, including drip tips in the leaves and oily coatings to repel the water.</p>

<p>Adaptations by animals in the grassland are quite different from rainforest animal adaptations. The rainforest alliance works hard to protect rainforests and the biodiversity within them through the sustainable management of tropical forests, restoring degraded land surrounding forests, and protecting rivers and streams. Size is no advantage in the rain forest where a dense understory makes movement difficult. Plants and animals in the u.k. Adaptation is where plants and animals have adjusted and changed in order to be able to survive in the conditions of their habitats.</p>
