<p><strong>Service Animals California Law</strong>. Since california’s law has a broader definition of public accommodations, the state requires “reasonable modifications to be carried out at any place “to which the general public is invited.” California law allows persons with disabilities to bring service dogs and emotional support animals to work, with some limitations. Nevada law defines service animals as dogs or miniature horses that have been trained to do work or perform a task that benefits a person with a disability (source). A service animal is any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability.</p>

Although service animal identification tags or vests are not mandatory in california, if you use a service dog, you are encouraged to obtain an identification tag verifying that your dog meets certain explicit requirements. California law allows persons with disabilities to bring trained service dogs and psychiatric service dogs, but not emotional support animals, to all public places. Nevada law defines service animals as dogs or miniature horses that have been trained to do work or perform a task that benefits a person with a disability (source).

The ada defines a service animal as any guide dog, signal dog, or other animal individually trained to provide assistance to an individual with a disability. However, in california, pretending to be an owner of a service dog is a criminal misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 (and/or up to six months imprisonment).

That means that before a service dog owner can enjoy all of the rights afforded to service dog owners under the ada, their dog must be fully trained to perform the task that assists with the handler’s disability.</p>

<p>California follows the ada but also makes an exception for animals that are used for psychiatric purchases.
