<p>If they stop respiring, they will die. Remember that respiration is not the same as breathing, so take care. Cellular respiration while 2 atp per glucose molecule is clearly better than nothing, it is not nearly enough to meet the energy needs of complex multicellular organisms such as plants and animals. If they stop respiring, they will die. Let us take a look at the respiratory.</p>

<p>To get the maximum atp yield from molecules of glucose requires cellular respiration, which and produce up to 36 atp per glucose molecule. To create atp and other forms of energy to power cellular reactions, cells require fuel and an electron acceptor which drives the chemical process of turning energy into a useable form. Your task in this lab is to determine whether or not various sets of bean seeds are going through cellular respiration. Plants need this in order to survive.

<p>Cellular respiration uses glucose and oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water. An increase in biomass for plants in the light is correlated with a decrease in co 2 in the surrounding air. Cellular respiration is a process consisting of many different metabolic reactions that take place inside of the cells of organisms. In this experiment, we will measure the rate of cellular respiration using either distilled water or one of four different food sources. These processes are able to convert different types of nutrients into energy and produce different waste products.</p>
