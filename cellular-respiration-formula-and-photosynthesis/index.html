Every machine needs specific parts and fuel in order to function. To create atp and other forms of energy to power cellular reactions, cells require fuel and an electron acceptor which drives the chemical process of turning energy into a useable form.

<p>The glucose is then used by the plants or organisms that consume the plants for the process of cellular respiration to make atp. This means it takes in nutrients from the cell, breaks it down, and turns it into energy. During cellular respiration, one glucose molecule combines with six oxygen molecules to produce water, carbon dioxide and 38 units of atp. Here is the equation for photosynthesis: Likewise, “biological machines” also require well engineered parts and good energy source in order to work.perhaps the second most important molecule (dna is the first) is adenosine triphosphate (also known as atp).basically, atp serves as the main energy currency of the cell.</p>

<p>Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are two biochemical reactions which have a crucial role to play when it comes to life on the planet earth. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere cellular respiration produces carbon dioxide ( co2 ) which is released back into the atmosphere. During cellular respiration, one glucose molecule combines with six oxygen molecules to produce water, carbon dioxide and 38 units of atp. In photosynthesis, the response solely takes place throughout the presence of chlorophyll whereas cellular respiration is unbiased of the catalyst for respiration response. Energy + carbon dioxide + water = glucose and oxygen.</p>

<p>This means it takes in nutrients from the cell, breaks it down, and turns it into energy. The relationship between photosynthesis and cellular respiration is such that the products of one system are the reactants of the other. Here are the formulas for photosynthesis and cellular respiration, also there is the facts of photosynthesis ms. The equation of cellular respiration helps in calculating the release of energy by breaking down glucose in the presence of oxygen in a cell. 6co2 + 6h2o + energy.</p>

<p>The formula for chemical respiration is But cellular respiration, let's us go from glucose to energy and some other byproducts. Atp, photosynthesis, and cellular respiration 1. Cell respiration and photosynthesis are essentially opposite processes. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere cellular respiration produces carbon dioxide ( co2 ) which is released back into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Photosynthesis is the food making process or energy storage process. Atp, photosynthesis, and cellular respiration 1. 6h2o + 6co2 → c6h12o6 + 6o2. See more ideas about high school biology, photosynthesis and cellular respiration, photosynthesis. This is why cellular respiration will be considered the opposite of photosynthesis.</p>
