And no matter what classification scheme one adheres to, humans fall into the mammalian category. You can split us in half one way, with a line drawn straight through our bodies. Under the many classifications of the animal kingdom, humans are classified as mammals. This question is one of scientific classification. A few mammals do not experience obvious, visible signs of fertility (concealed ovulation).in humans, while women can learn to recognize their own level of fertility (fertility awareness), whether men can detect fertility in women is debated;</p>
