<p>The other difference between the cell wall and plasma membrane is with regards to their respective components. What makes up the bilayer in the cell. The cell membrane can move without tearing and can fix itself after breaking like a fluid would. Phospholipids are lipid molecules made up of a phosphate group head and two fatty acid tails. The cell membrane separates the cell from the surrounding interstitial fluid, the main component of the extracellular fluid. Cell membrane, also called plasma membrane, thin membrane that surrounds every living cell, delimiting the cell from the environment around it.</p>
<h3 id="the-cell-membrane-is-made-up-of-a-phospholipid-bilayer">The cell membrane is made up of a phospholipid bilayer.</h3><p>This difference makes a cell wall more elastic than the plasma. Body cells can be categorized into about 300 types, such as neurons, epithelial cells, muscle cells, and red bloodcells each type of cell has a special structure for carrying out particular functions although these cells differ in size, shape, and function. As is the case with animal cells, the cell membrane in plants is a lipid bilayer. The cell membrane is made up of two layers of molecules, so it's called bilayer (bi means two). All the living things are made up ofcells the human body is made up of about 75 trillion cells, the tiniest living systems that exist. The cell membrane allows the exchange of only specific or selective molecules between the cell and surrounding, and thus it also refers to as “selectively permeable membrane”.</p>

<p>A phospholipid molecule consists of a glycerol molecule, combined with one phosphate group and two fatty acid molecules. The (hydrophobic) tails of these phospholipids face each other. Cell membranes contain a variety of biological molecules, notably lipids and proteins. Material is incorporated into the membrane, or deleted from it, by a variety of mechanisms: The cell membrane is a bilayer of phospholipids.</p>

<p>The proteins are found around the holes and help move molecules in and out of the cell. It's made up of phospholipids and also contains protein and carbohydrate molecules. This is accomplished by the embedding of various protein molecules in and through the lipid bilayer (see figure below). The membrane is partially made up of molecules called phospholipids, which spontaneously arrange themselves into a double layer with hydrophilic (“water loving”) heads on the outside and hydrophobic (“water hating”) tails on the inside.

<p>Bacteria all the way up to great blue whales are made of cells, which all perform their own specific duties. The bilayer is formed by the arrangement of phospholipids in a manner that their head regions (which are hydrophilic) face external environment as well as the internal cytosolic environment. Whereas a cell wall consists of chitin, lignin, sugar, cellulose , and pectin among other molecules, the plasma membrane is mostly made up of the phospholipid bilayer.

<p>The cell membrane is primarily composed of a mix of proteins and lipids. It is made of millions of smaller molecules that create a flexible and porous container. The cell membrane is not a solid structure. The cell is made up of three parts, the membrane, the cytoplasm, and the nucleus.

<p>But, i think that both surfaces of the membrane can interact with water and other molecules is the correct answer because the cholesterol in the membrane is what makes it easily change size and shape. As is the case with animal cells, the cell membrane in plants is a lipid bilayer. So, cells make up every living thing that exists. The bilayer is formed by the arrangement of phospholipids in a manner that their head regions (which are hydrophilic) face external environment as well as the internal cytosolic environment. The membrane’s interior is made up of oily fatty acid molecules that are electrostatically symmetric, or nonpolarized.</p>

<p>The cell is made up of three parts, the membrane, the cytoplasm, and the nucleus. Bacteria all the way up to great blue whales are made of cells, which all perform their own specific duties. Cell membranes contain a variety of biological molecules, notably lipids and proteins. Proteins and phospholipids make up most of the membrane structure. The cell membrane is a bilayer of phospholipids.</p>

<p>The membrane is partially made up of molecules called phospholipids, which spontaneously arrange themselves into a double layer with hydrophilic (“water loving”) heads on the outside and hydrophobic (“water hating”) tails on the inside. Proteins and phospholipids make up most of the membrane structure. Body cells can be categorized into about 300 types, such as neurons, epithelial cells, muscle cells, and red bloodcells each type of cell has a special structure for carrying out particular functions although these cells differ in size, shape, and function. It is a selectively permeable cell organelle,allowing certain substances inside the cell while preventing others to pass through and thus is analogous to a barrier or gatekeeper in their function. As is the case with animal cells, the cell membrane in plants is a lipid bilayer.</p>
