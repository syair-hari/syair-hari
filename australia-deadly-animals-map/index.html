<p>One of my favourite things about australia is the wildlife, but for many others it can be an off putting factor. Not the largest, but the most aggressive Some people know it as the world’s smallest continent, some recognize it as the surfer’s haven, but the thing that makes australia truly unique in the world is its highly peculiar, but also quite deadly fauna.from poisonous snakes and spiders, to highly aggressive birds, australia is considered to be the home of the most dangerous animals. In snakes alone we have over 100 venomous species and adding sea creatures to the list australia has over 300 varieties of venomous species and over 150 of them are deadly. Some 83% of mammals, 89% of reptiles, 90% of fish and insects and 93% of amphibians that inhabit the continent are endemic to australia.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the death rate is surprisingly no higher than in europe. Its a known fact that the number of snakes is so big that there would be a snake every 100 metres in australia if calculate the area of land with the nu. Not the largest, but the most aggressive This australian magpie got himself some lunch image by sandid from pixabay 33. They are very dangerous to human beings if provoked as their venom contains a neurotoxin which is dangerous enough to kill humans.</p>
