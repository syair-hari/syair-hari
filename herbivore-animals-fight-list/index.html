Herbivory is a form of consumption in which a heterotrophic organism consumes other organisms, principally autotrophs [page needed] such as plants, algae and photosynthesizing bacteria.more generally, organisms that feed on autotrophs in general are known as 1st level consumers Herbivorous animals have to find the plants that they want to eat, but they do not have to catch them.
