We might have a passenger pigeon again in ten years, says author. So if someone was going to bring back the passenger pigeon, then i think you could justify that. The passenger pigeon, the dodo and the woolly mammoth are just a few of the species wiped off the earth by changing environments and human activities.</p>

<p>10 recently extinct game animals charles r. But using genetic engineering to bring back extinct animals might be considered reasonable in some circumstances. They have gone as far as successfully creating an embryo. The passenger pigeon, the dodo and the woolly mammoth are just a few of the species wiped off the earth by changing environments and human activities. They were a vital food source for the amerindians for many years.</p>

<p>As of today, less than 1,000 remain in existence, which is extreme compared to many other species on the endangered list. Bringing back the extinct animals sounds like a great idea, but when they actually come back to life, there will be lots of consequences, for us and the animals. Professors from the university of new south wales are determined to bring these frogs back to life. 10 animals that may not be as extinct as we thought… 10 awesome extinct animals people don't talk about… 10 endangered animals that could become extinct in a… 10 stories of animals that fought back against poachers; Generally, it helps if there is a species still alive today that is genetically similar to the extinct animal, like elephants for woolly mammoths or cows for aurochs.</p>

<p>There are some extinct species — such as the woolly mammoth, shown above — that may be brought back to life if scientists can overcome some practical hurdles and thorny ethical questions. Generally, it helps if there is a species still alive today that is genetically similar to the extinct animal, like elephants for woolly mammoths or cows for aurochs. 'i think there is potentially an argument for bringing back something that we humans made extinct. I say no to this question using three sources to give reasons and support my claim. The passenger pigeon, the dodo and the woolly mammoth are just a few of the species wiped off the earth by changing environments and human activities.</p>
