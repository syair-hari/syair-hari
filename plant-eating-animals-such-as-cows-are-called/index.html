<p>Some of the signs of poisoning include twitching lips, open mouth and involuntary chewing movements; Cows are not the only ruminant animals. It’s often been called “chewing disease”. The cellulose carbohydrate present in grass can be digested by the action of certain bacteria which are present only in the stomach of animals called ruminants like cattle (cows, buffaloes) goat, sheep, deer. • a monkey loves to eat bananas and nuts.

<h3 id="cows-are-known-as-ruminants-because-the-largest-pouch-of-the-stomach-is-called-the-rumen">Cows are known as “ruminants” because the largest pouch of the stomach is called the rumen.</h3><p>Some animals eat grass as food. The results of poisoning can range from minor irritations and slightly lowered animal performance to severe cases where the animal is in a great deal of distress and may die. The herbivorous animals eat mainly grass and other plant leaves as food. Herbivores with multiple stomach chambers — such as camels, deer, sheep, giraffes and cattle — are called ruminants. The cellulose carbohydrate present in grass can be digested by the action of certain bacteria which are present only in the stomach of animals called ruminants like cattle (cows, buffaloes) goat, sheep, deer. There are many plants which contain chemicals or which accumulate chemicals that are poisonous to livestock.</p>
