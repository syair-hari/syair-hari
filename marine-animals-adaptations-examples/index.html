<p>The article marine organisms and adaptations provides additional information about these categories. There are many adaptations made by plants and animals. The kangaroo rat in north american deserts is capable of meeting all its water requirement by internal oxidation of fat (water is a byproduct) in absence of water. Animals can derive a lot of benefit from spending time with other members of the same species. These small animals have found evolutionary ways to protect themselves from harsh weather conditions. True | false 1.the body shape of marine animals, like fish, is an example of adaptation.</p>

Some broad categories of animals that live in the marine biome include fish, whales, crustaceans, mollusks, sea anemones, fungi, and bacteria. They fill their lungs and exchange 90% of their air in each breath, have high blood volume, and their blood chemistry allows greater oxygen retention (the high red blood cell count and increased. These can include chemical defences in their skin, for example, sea stars. Describe how, when the environment. For example, many marine organisms can only move slowly or not all.</p>

Many animals are able to engage in certain behaviors which have no discernible function and may not be a part of adaptation. Adapted to survive in environments where low temperatures or extreme cold prevail, these animals have undergone special adaptations such as the musky ox and its bushy coat; This is key to the difference between an animal's adaptation and ability.</p>

<p>The adaptation of animals and plants to their environment is a series of varied biological processes with varying purposes, but the general purpose is the continued survival of the species. These are all just basic adaptations for fish, there are many specific ones for the conditions the animal or plant lives in. These are special attributes that involve some parts of an organism’s body, such as skin, colour and shape. Examples of invertebrates in the marine biome include jellyfish, sponges, sea worms, shellfish, sea stars or starfish, squids, octopi, crabs, etc. Antarctic animal adaptations long days providing abundant light and copious nutrients brought to the surface layers by ocean upwellings along the antarctic convergence fertilize the growth of phytoplankton leading to very high productivity of the antarctic ocean during the summer months.</p>

<p>A variety of organisms that live in marine biomes. Lastly, aquatic animals have lots of adaptations for moving in the water, like a streamlined design, flippers, and a swim bladder, which acts like a ballast for the fish. Some broad categories of animals that live in the marine biome include fish, whales, crustaceans, mollusks, sea anemones, fungi, and bacteria. This means they cannot easily get away from mobile predators, and they have other adaptations to protect them from being eaten. These are special attributes that involve some parts of an organism’s body, such as skin, colour and shape.</p>
