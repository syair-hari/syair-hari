<p><strong>Tundra Biome Animals And Their Adaptations</strong>. The animals and plants of arctic region are known for their adaptations which protect them from the harsh weather. Organisms that live in the tundra biome have developed unique adaptations that aid in their survival. A good example of an animal with special adaptations is the arctic fox.the arctic fox has short ears and a short, round body with a thick coat to minimize the amount of skin exposed to the frigid air. Migration and hibernation are examples of behavioral adaptations used by animals in the arctic tundra.</p>

<p>Other animals such as arctic and tundra wolves, polar bears and musk ox are also well adapted to the arctic environment. Tundra plant adaptations many plants are perennials, which means they save up their energy and nutrients for multiple growing seasons before flowering. Some resident animals of the arctic tundra biome change their colour during different seasons of the year. Animals that live in the tundra have special adaptations that allow them to survive the extreme temperatures and conditions that are present in a tundra. Plant adaptations in the desert, rainforest and tundra allow plants and trees to sustain life. One of the best examples of the same is the commensal relationship between the arctic fox and caribou, where the caribou digs the ground to feed on lichen, and in the process, brings to the surface insects and small mammals for the arctic fox to feed on.</p>

<p>One of the best examples of the same is the commensal relationship between the arctic fox and caribou, where the caribou digs the ground to feed on lichen, and in the process, brings to the surface insects and small mammals for the arctic fox to feed on. The world has three types of tundra: Adaptations can include such traits as narrow leaves, waxy surfaces, sharp spines and specialized root systems. But, sadly this particular biome's animals are quickly dying off from the melting snow from global warming or just humans killing either from weapons or pollution. A good example of an animal with special adaptations is the arctic fox.the arctic fox has short ears and a short, round body with a thick coat to minimize the amount of skin exposed to the frigid air.</p>

<p>This provides traction on the ice so they can walk on it and also protect its feet from the cold. For example, ptarmigan (a kind of bird) changes the colour of its feathers thrice a year. It is able to keep its body temperature approximately 75ºf above. However, there are a variety of animals found in this region. Plant adaptations in the desert, rainforest and tundra allow plants and trees to sustain life.</p>

<p>Animal adaptations in the tundra biome animals have many adaptations to survive in this harsh environment. Some tundra plants are protected by hair. They have to have special adaptations to allow them to live in extreme conditions and low temperatures.

<p>The predators that roam the tundra biome are polar bears, arctic foxes, and wolves. The arctic foxes and stoat, prominent predator animals having fur coat, are brown in colour during summer season but become white in colour during. Tundra adaptations size and shape snow and avoid the most severe conditions of winter. Just as fur traps air and acts as an insulator in animals, hairy outgrowths on plants keeps their temperature more moderate and prevents freezing. Animals such as mammals and birds.</p>

<p>The animals and plants of arctic region are known for their adaptations which protect them from the harsh weather. Willows have hair around their flowers that is able to raise the temperature near the flower to 5f to 15f higher than the air temperature. Animal adaptations in the tundra biome animals have many adaptations to survive in this harsh environment. Their coat changes color (in the summer the fur is reddish brown to act as a camouflage, and in the winter it turns white to blend into the snowy environment.

<p>Plant adaptations in the desert, rainforest and tundra allow plants and trees to sustain life. Organisms that live in the tundra biome have developed unique adaptations that aid in their survival. The conservation institute notes that there are a few common elements that tie many tundra animals together, such as heat retention in the body, trapped air insulation, fat insulation and oil that keeps moisture at bay. Many of them have larger bodies and shorter arms, legs and tails which helps them retain their heat better and prevent. They have short heavily furred, rounded ears (to protect from the cold).</p>

<p>Tundra hares are larger and have shorter ears than hares that live in hot environments. Here are a few adaptations that make them suitable to this biome: Arctic foxes have shorter ears than desert kit foxes. Tundra wildlife includes small mammals—such as norway lemmings ( lemmus lemmus ), arctic hares ( lepis arcticus ), and arctic ground squirrels ( spermophilus parryii )—and large mammals, such as caribou ( rangifer tarandus ). Tundra is a biome where low temperatures and short growing seasons result in sparse tree cover on land.</p>

<p>They have short heavily furred, rounded ears (to protect from the cold). A large variety of animals live in the tundra for the whole year. Many of them have larger bodies and shorter arms, legs and tails which helps them retain their heat better and prevent. Bearberry is a low growing plant that uses that adaptation to stay out of the way of the ripping tundra wind.it also favors places like behind rocks to again stay out of the wind.the leathery leaves keeps moisture and heat inside the plant. Tundra hares are larger and have shorter ears than hares that live in hot environments.</p>
