<p>The dog’s trainer or handler is required to teach that animal to recognize. The ada is a federal law which requires businesses and organizations that serve the public to allow people with disabilities to bring their service animals into all areas of the facility where customers are normally allowed to go. Service animals in training are not covered under the ada. The benefits of service animals and emotional support animals are immense. California law allows persons with disabilities to bring trained service dogs and psychiatric service dogs, but not emotional support animals, to all public places.</p>

<p>Schools have a legal responsibility to provide planning and services for children with special healthcare needs, including allowing service animals into schools (towle, 2017). A legal update, 327 ed. Is this legal under the ada? In addition, the individuals with disabilities education act (idea) and section 504 of the rehabilitation act allow a student to use an animal that does not meet the ada definition of a service. The rule says only dogs can qualify, and they have to be specially trained to help a person.</p>

<p>Dogs are the most common service animals, assisting people in many different ways since at least 1927. Schools have a legal responsibility to provide planning and services for children with special healthcare needs, including allowing service animals into schools (towle, 2017). The department of justice published revised final regulations implementing the americans with disabilities act (ada) for title ii (state and local government services) and title iii (public accommodations and commercial facilities) on september 15, 2010, in the federal register. The rule says only dogs can qualify, and they have to be specially trained to help a person. The protections discussed above do not apply to emotional support animals.</p>
