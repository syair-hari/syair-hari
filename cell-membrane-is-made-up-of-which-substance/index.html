<p>Although this membrane serves to protect the cell and its components, it is also surface through which substances are exchanged and information shared with other cells. The cell membrane is made up of a phospholipid bilayer. Since the cell membrane is made up of a lipid bilayer with proteins attached on the surface and also passing through the cell membrane, there is possibility of transport across this membrane. This cell membrane provides a protective barrier around the cell and regulates which materials can pass in or out. Everything in the cell sits in the cytosol, like fruit in a jello mold.the term cytoplasm refers to the cytosol and all of the organelles, the specialized compartments of the cell.</p>

<p>Composition of bilayer cell membrane. The rest is a mixture of molecules, mainly proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. Phospholipids are lipid molecules made up of a phosphate group head and two fatty acid tails. A cell is the structural, functional and biological unit of all organisms. The membrane acts as a boundary, holding the cell constituents together and keeping other substances from entering.</p>

<p>O 2 and co 2. A substance, located in the cell membrane and made of amino acids, that binds with specific molecules, causing a change in the cell. The membrane also contains membrane proteins, including integral proteins that go across the Cells are made up of organelles, which are analogous to our bodily organs. Therefore, he concluded that the plasma membrane was made up of lipid.</p>
