<p>The term food chain describes the order in which organisms, or living things , depend on each other for food. To understand how plants and animals interact, scientists make diagrams called food chains. The food chain describes who eats whom in the wild. The grasshopper eats grass, the frog eats the grasshopper, the snake eats the frog, and the eagle eats the snake. The term food chain describes the order in which organisms, or living things , depend on each other for food.</p>

<p>The soil then becomes rich and fertile, allowing plants to grow and produce energy for a new food chain. Living things are linked through their food. For example, a zebra eats grass, and the zebra is eaten by the lion. The mice are eaten by snakes, and then finally the snakes are eaten by hawks. A food chain in a grassland ecosystem may consist of grasses and other plants, grasshoppers, frogs, snakes and hawks (figure 8.3).</p>

<p>Bursting with activities that explore the characteristics of carnivores, herbivores and omnivores, these ks1 food chain resources are excellent to use in your science lessons. Plants use the sun’s energy to make their own food, while animals eat plants or other. It starts with the primary source, like the sun or hydrothermal vents, where producers make food, continues with consumers, or animals who eat the food, and ends with the top predator. What is the food chain? See food chain stock video clips.</p>

<p>Here's another food chain, with a few more animals. In this lesson we are going to talk all about food chains and food webs in the environment. These links are called food chains. Plants use the sun’s energy to make their own food, while animals eat plants or other. Within a food chain, some living things create the energy (producers) and some use the energy (consumers).plants are producers of energy, as they make their own food (using sunlight, soil, and other elements).;</p>

<p>The term food chain describes the order in which organisms, or living things , depend on each other for food. Animals are consumers, because they have to eat other animals. A rabbit eats the grass. A food chain is a flow of energy from a green plant (producer) to an animal (consumer) and to another animal (another consumer) and so on. Therefore, in this case the food chain is often defined as a process of moving food energy that moves linearly from the producer organism to the top consumer.</p>
