Only 48 species of terrestrial mammals like reindeer, arctic fox, musk ox, arctic hare, etc., live in this harsh environment. Tundra tundra is the global biome that consists of the treeless regions in the north (arctic tundra) and high mountains (alpine tundra). Penguins are found in the antarctic tundra habitat where they inhabit the land and waters of coastal antarctica.</p>
