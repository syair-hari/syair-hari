<p>A consumer is a living thing that eats other living things to stay alive. A producer is an organism that makes it’s own food from light energy or chemical energy. The plants in the rainforest play an important role in the rainforest food chain as well. Food production in rain forests continues to form a major part of the worlds every day existence, with towns, cities and entire countries relying on the biome as a source of food. Platypus eats mostly insects and plankton, but also frogs and small fish.</p>

<p>Home to rainforest relationships are better described as a web — a rainforest food web. Insects eat plants =&gt; rodents eat insects =&gt; snakes eat rodents =&gt; birds of prey eat snakes. Rainforests outside of the border ranges include dry rainforest types which also contain many taxa with highly localised distributions. Rainforest food chains are the pathways along which food is transferred between different trophic levels within rainforest ecosystem. Study of a food chain provides us with information about which organisms act as predators and prey in a particular ecosystem.</p>
