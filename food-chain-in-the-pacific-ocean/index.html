Below is the food web for ocean ecosystem and the way in which those organisms interact and depend on each other for survival. Climate change could alter ocean food chains, leading to far fewer fish in the sea april 19, 2018 6.50am edt jefferson keith moore , university of california, irvine In general, food webs with low biodiversity are more vulnerable to changes than food webs with high biodiversity.</p>
