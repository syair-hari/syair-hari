<p>Help save animals membership is a great way to support the outstanding wildlife conservation work of the smithsonian's national zoo and conservation biology institute and ensure that your family's experience at the zoo is always special and enriching. Turtles have been swimming in our oceans for at least 110 million years! You pledge not to wear anything that comes from animals such as leather. Researchers gather this information by using “trail cameras” that take pictures of animals in an area. By volunteering you’ll not only make a difference in your local animal rescue community, you’ll be helping to save animals in need.</p>
