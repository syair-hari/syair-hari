Giant anteaters generally prefer staying on the forest floor in search of their food and do not reside on trees unlike other members of their species. The forest floor, also called detritus, duff and the o horizon, is one of the most distinctive features of a forest ecosystem.it mainly consists of shed vegetative parts, such as leaves, branches, bark, and stems, existing in various stages of decomposition above the soil surface. The forest floor receives the least sunlight of all the layers and so only plants that can survive with low light will survive here.
