<p>Some animals hibernate during the winter and arise in spring when food is more plentiful. Introduction when you look up 'temperate rain forest' (trf) you realise how much of it there is.one definition of trfs is alaback's definition for north american trf: Temperate forests grow in regions that have a wide range of climates, and despite the fact there are fewer plant and animals species than in the rainforest, temperate forests are one of the richest habitats on the planet. The areas in the middle latitudes are characterized by four distinct seasons: As a result, most temperate forests have deciduous plants, trees and flowers.</p>

<p>The sun shines through the orange, red, and gold leaves. Deciduous forests are broken up into five zones. In particular, they like walnuts and winged seeds which actually keep a long time. Toward the polar regions they grade into boreal forests dominated by conifers, creating mixed forests of deciduous and coniferous trees. Many animals escape the harsh conditions by migrating to warmer regions in winter.</p>
