<p>Top ocean predators include large sharks, billfish, dolphins, toothed whales, and large seals. Some of this material sinks down into the deeper ocean, providing food for deep sea ecosystems. The ocean has an immense, precariously complex food chain, varying from microscopic animals, like krill, to whales, which ironically feed mainly on the former. Open ocean, a vast biotope covering two thirds of the planet, some shallow, some as deep as the mountain ranges are high. A food chain is a linear network of links in a food web starting from producer organisms (such as grass or trees which use radiation from the sun to make their food) and ending at apex predator species (like grizzly bears or killer whales), detritivores (like earthworms or woodlice), or decomposer species (such as fungi or bacteria).a food chain also shows how the organisms are related with. A chain has different sections or parts.</p>

The marine biome is the largest in the world, and therefore contributes to intricate food webs. There are so many people that is relying on natural resources such as plant and animals. The marine food chain is one amongst them. An ocean food chain shows how energy is passed from one organism, living thing, to another in the ocean.</p>

<p>The struggle for food is one of the most important and complex activities to occur in an ecosystem. Food chains, food webs &amp; the atlantic ocean. The next level of the marine food chain is made up of animals that feast on the sea's abundant plant life. The ocean has an immense, precariously complex food chain, varying from microscopic animals, like krill, to whales, which ironically feed mainly on the former. Open ocean, a vast biotope covering two thirds of the planet, some shallow, some as deep as the mountain ranges are high.</p>

<p>The deep ocean is filled with sea creatures like giant larvaceans. In the oceans, also known as the marine environment, food chains also work in much the same way. This plant biomass is consumed by other organisms and the energy is transferred up the food web to higher organisms. The ocean has an immense, precariously complex food chain, varying from microscopic animals, like krill, to whales, which ironically feed mainly on the former. A food chain is a linear network of links in a food web starting from producer organisms (such as grass or trees which use radiation from the sun to make their food) and ending at apex predator species (like grizzly bears or killer whales), detritivores (like earthworms or woodlice), or decomposer species (such as fungi or bacteria).a food chain also shows how the organisms are related with.</p>

<p>Food chain contains both animal and plants which is really important for human. This lobate ctenophore is eating krill. Michael roman of the university of maryland center for environmental science stated traces of oil in the zooplankton prove that they had contact with the oil and the likelihood that oil compounds may be working their way up the food chain. On the ocean's surface waters, microscopic animals—zooplankton, which include jellyfish. Oceanography and marine science unravels many unsolved mysteries which fascinate mankind even today.</p>
