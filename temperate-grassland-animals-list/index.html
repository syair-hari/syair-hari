<p>Temperate grasslands can be found in various regions north and south of the equator including argentina, australia, and central north america. Several animals, like chipmunks and squirrels, store foods such as nuts and seeds for the winters. Temperate grasslands have a low diversity of wildlife, but a high abundance of wildlife. Several species of snakes thrive in the grasslands, including the harmless garter snake and poisonous. Temperatures vary with seasons with tornadoes, blizzards, and fires occurring in many temperate grassland regions.</p>

<p>Temperate grassland is known as plains or prairie in north america, pampas in south america, steppes in eastern europe and mongolia and veld in southern africa. A case example is the garter snake. Several animals, like chipmunks and squirrels, store foods such as nuts and seeds for the winters. Grasslands have a special climate because they contain a lot of grass, very few trees, periods of rainfall and typically dry climates, which is why the animals that inhabit the grassy areas have special visual and internal adaptations to deal with the ecosystem. Females have smaller horns than males and sometimes are barely visible.</p>
