<p>The bilayer is formed by the arrangement of phospholipids in a manner that their head regions (which are hydrophilic) face external environment as well as the internal cytosolic environment. It provides the container for the cell contents and allows only small uncharged molecules to pass through while keeping larger molecules at bay.

Your cells turn the raw materials in the food you eat into the molecules your bo. Plasma membrane is the outermost covering of the cell which is made up of phospholipids. The cell membrane consists of a lipid bilayer, including cholesterols that sit between phospholipids to maintain their fluidity at various temperatures.</p>

<p>If we count molecules, the main component of the cell membrane is phospholipid material. Depending on the membrane’s location and role in the body, lipids can make up anywhere from 20 to 80 percent of the membrane, with the remainder being proteins. A phospholipid is a lipid that contains a phosphate group and is a major component of cell membranes. The cell membrane separates the cell from the surrounding interstitial fluid, the main component of the extracellular fluid. It provides the container for the cell contents and allows only small uncharged molecules to pass through while keeping larger molecules at bay.</p>

<p>Cytoplasm covered by plasma membrane containing cytoplasmic organelles; The cell membrane consists of three classes of amphipathic lipids: A phospholipid is a lipid that contains a phosphate group and is a major component of cell membranes. A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of the body. It keeps all the internal components — or cytoplasm — of a cell inside of it, and the external items outside of it.</p>
