<p>The tundra climate represents the coldest biome on earth. They are solitary animals that will do very well in the tundra biome due to their adaptive nature. This is a fairly small animal with a very thick coat. The average weight is about 8 to20 pounds. Many tundra insects and spiders are dark in colour, which absorbs more sunlight and allows these animals to maintain higher body temperatures.</p>
