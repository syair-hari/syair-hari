<p>California state law (csl) service animals are allowed in dining and sales areas “not used for food preparation” only, and employees with service animals must wash their hands after handling the animal. The new regulations significantly expand protections for disabled workers and outline new requirements regarding reasonable. However, employers are required to consider service animals as part of an employee’s request for reasonable accommodation under title i of the ada.
