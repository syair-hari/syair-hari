Liver cells are in animals. No only plants have chloroplasts, animals get sugar from the food they eat so they don't need them just a mitochondria.

Tridacna giant clams can grow at an incredible speed. One species of sea slug has found a way to steal chloroplasts, store them in glands lining its digestive tract, and live on the sugar that is produced (milius, 2010).

<p>You know this because you have to eat. Chloroplasts are the remnants of a free. Harsh nov 14, 2015 that's because animals are heterotrophic , they cannot prepare their own food. Chloroplasts are a type of plastid, distinguished by their green color, the result of specialized chlorophyll pigments. The animals need only direct light and carbon dioxide and have the ability to live healthily for months, often getting most of their energy from photosynthesis.</p>

Different types of specialized cells are found in different tissues and have features relative to their function e.g. A little freshwater jellyfish called hydra pinches chloroplasts out of green algae and keeps them in its own gut. See elysia chlorotica whose cells actively take up chloroplasts and use them, and keep them alive (though not replicating).</p>

<p>Why don't animal cells have chloroplasts? Chlorotica can go longer without eating algae than any others. The only thing that would make it a little bit different is with animal like algae, which might contain some chloroplasts,. Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have their own dna. It lets them photosynthesise and nicks the sugars that they produce.</p>
