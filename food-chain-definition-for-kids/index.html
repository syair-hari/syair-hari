<p>The definition of âfood chainâ is an order of things that are living which feed on other living things below it. A rabbit eats the grass. The plants get their energy from the sun. A food chain shows a sequence of living things in which one organism eats the one below it. The food chain also explains the feeding pattern or relationship between living organisms.</p>
