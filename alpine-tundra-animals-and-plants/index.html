<p>Alpine tundras can support animals such as marmots, mountain goats, elk, grouse type birds, and other various insects. The alpaca usually lives in the andes mountains but can still be found in other locations. But it is not a uniform zone that can sustain too many plants. This is truly a land of extremes. These hardy plants are the polar willow, salix polaris;</p>
