<p>Police officers and firefighters often carry small toys, usually stuffed animals, to comfort scared and injured children on the scene. Any stuffed animals that are in relatively good shape (no huge stains, limbs missing, etc) are good to give away, but check with the organization (some are cautious because of allergens). Donated items are sold in the family store and the proceeds are used to fund the salvation army’s adult rehabilitation centers. They are always looking for toys to keep the animals happy. Brighten the smile of a child in need by donating gently used stuffed animals to charity.</p>

<p>Having a stuffed toy to cuddle can help children to feel safe during times like natural disasters or during an ambulance ride, for example. Collect items to give to children in emotional, traumatic, or stressful situations (like fires, illness, abuse, homelessness, and natural disasters) accepts: As the kiddos raked in tons of new toys, their old toys are soon to be forgotten. So call your local police and fire departments to find out whether they would like some gently used toys. Any stuffed animals that are in relatively good shape (no huge stains, limbs missing, etc) are good to give away, but check with the organization (some are cautious because of allergens).</p>
