<p>As mcleod explained to the spruce pets, they have a docile nature that makes them easy to get along with and play with, but they also don't need a lot in terms of care. Compared to other fox species, fennecs have very little odor that only decreases even more if they are neutered. Most small animals tend to smell due to the cage being too small, or not cleaned frequently enough. There are a few that you can choose from, you just want to make sure that whatever exotic pet that you are considering, is legal in your state. They are active, vocal, and entertaining to watch. Honestly, the bigger the cage, the less an animal will smell.</p>
<h3 id="a-goldfish-is-an-inadvisable-pet-if-you-have-a-cat">A goldfish is an inadvisable pet if you have a cat.</h3><p>In fact, the gecko relies on this lack of scent to catch prey when they are in the wild. I would suggest rats though! Most small animals tend to smell due to the cage being too small, or not cleaned frequently enough. If you want a mammal, something like a hamster, mice or pair of gerbils are probably going to cost you the least. Chinchillas, like hamsters and mice, are pets more to appreciate by watching instead of interacting with them. All you need is a little effort during the initial setup, like setting up an aquarium, water plants, setting up the water filter, food pellets etc.</p>

<p>Ants don't poop as much as other animals do. The small animal pets can be a little bit more to take care of when compared to fish or reptiles, but small animals can be a great apartment pet. Rabbits i think do have a little smell, but shouldn't, again, if you clean the hutch often/ or change bedding. Rabbits are social and friendly animals, and adapt very well to human companionship. When it comes to keeping a fox as a pet, fennecs are winners because their small size and lack of smells makes them suitable as house pets.</p>

<p>True rats are members of the genus rattus, the most important of which to humans are the black rat, rattus rattus, and the brown rat, rattus norvegicus. Most small animals tend to smell due to the cage being too small, or not cleaned frequently enough. Don't get mice then, i had two mice and no matter how often you clean them out or what bedding you use, they still stink. The small animal pets can be a little bit more to take care of when compared to fish or reptiles, but small animals can be a great apartment pet. The cat may attempt to capture and devour live fish.</p>

<p>They are active, vocal, and entertaining to watch. Red, grey, and arctic foxes actually have a pungent smell that is similar to skunk smell. A goldfish is an inadvisable pet if you have a cat. All you need is a little effort during the initial setup, like setting up an aquarium, water plants, setting up the water filter, food pellets etc. True rats are members of the genus rattus, the most important of which to humans are the black rat, rattus rattus, and the brown rat, rattus norvegicus.</p>

<p>It is definitely one of the best small pets for kids and it is easy to take care of. Many small animals don't smell if you clean their hutch/cage out often. It is definitely one of the best small pets for kids and it is easy to take care of. In fact, the gecko relies on this lack of scent to catch prey when they are in the wild. The gecko is another animal which can be a great pet.</p>

<p>They are easy to tame and they do not smell. In fact, the gecko relies on this lack of scent to catch prey when they are in the wild. I would suggest rats though! What some people don’t realize is that rabbits aren’t just outdoor pets to be kept in hutches. These can make lovely pets, but i don’t suggest them as starter pets.</p>

<p>Although they were lovely pets they did stink. All the same, aquatic pets will never fail to capture a cat’s imagination. I’ve even split the pets into 7 more general species — so let’s start with fish! I was wondering if there is any type of rodents that don't smell badly Chinchillas, like hamsters and mice, are pets more to appreciate by watching instead of interacting with them.</p>

<p>Chinchillas live to be about 10 years old. There is not much work involved with them. More than anything else, that experience taught me that fish don’t really agree with me, mostly because i like having a pet i can actually interact with. Guinea pigs have odourless pee coz they don't have scent glands or something. If their habitat area is maintained consistently, there will be no noticeable odor coming from the gecko.</p>

<p>These pets don’t need very much to survive. Don't forget about the geckos! Keep the temperature at 72 to 80 degrees fahrenheit (22 to 27 degrees celsius). “pocket pets” are what people call small domestic animals such as gerbils, hamsters, ferrets and rabbits. Pets are great at keeping you company as well as helping your kids learn about the concept of responsibility, and caring.</p>

<p>They don't stink and are fun to watch make ant farms. They are easy to tame and they do not smell. I have recently had 2 female pet rats, who smelled really bad even though i cleared the cage out 3 times a week and treated them like they were queens. Many people opt to adopt a pocket pet as opposed to a dog or cat because they are easier to take care of, and they don’t require as much attention as their canine and feline counterparts.whether you live in a small space and cannot have a large animal, you’re gone all the time and. Rabbits i think do have a little smell, but shouldn't, again, if you clean the hutch often/ or change bedding.</p>

<p>You have to clean them out once a week and be sure to clean up any dirty areas every day or every other day but thats it. These adorable creatures are social animals and need a lot of interaction. Some of the easiest small pets to care for that don’t smell are hamsters, gerbils, fancy rats, and rabbits. Like cats, rabbits can be litterbox trained easily, and while cats themselves rarely have any noticeable body odor, rabbit droppings are far less smelly than cat droppings. They don't stink and are fun to watch make ant farms.</p>

<p>They are active, vocal, and entertaining to watch. Keep the temperature at 72 to 80 degrees fahrenheit (22 to 27 degrees celsius). Your kids would love to watch colorful fishes and their activities every now and then. Sea monkeys are incredibly fascinating. Chinchillas can make wonderful pets for the right family.</p>

If their habitat area is maintained consistently, there will be no noticeable odor coming from the gecko. Most small animals tend to smell due to the cage being too small, or not cleaned frequently enough. Your kids would love to watch colorful fishes and their activities every now and then.</p>

<p>Chinchillas live to be about 10 years old. Keep the temperature at 72 to 80 degrees fahrenheit (22 to 27 degrees celsius). Rabbits are social and friendly animals, and adapt very well to human companionship. They can also make for wonderful indoor companions. All you need is a little effort during the initial setup, like setting up an aquarium, water plants, setting up the water filter, food pellets etc.</p>

<p>They can also make for wonderful indoor companions. They can make a good bit of noise with their thumping though, so be prepared for that. A good small pet would be a pair of rats. I have recently had 2 female pet rats, who smelled really bad even though i cleared the cage out 3 times a week and treated them like they were queens. They have no noticeable odor, but if you bury your face in their fur, they have a mild, sort of flowery, sweet natural smell.</p>

<p>Rabbits i think do have a little smell, but shouldn't, again, if you clean the hutch often/ or change bedding. So if you cleaned the cage out it wouldn't smell. Chinchillas, like hamsters and mice, are pets more to appreciate by watching instead of interacting with them. Some of the easiest small pets to care for that don’t smell are hamsters, gerbils, fancy rats, and rabbits. They don't stink and are fun to watch make ant farms.</p>
