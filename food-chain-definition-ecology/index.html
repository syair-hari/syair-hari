In scientific terms, a food chain is a chronological pathway or an order that shows the flow of energy from one organism to the other. It shows the flow of energy and materials from one organism to the next, beginning with a producer. [ fōōd ] the sequence of the transfer of food energy from one organism to another in an ecological community. Every level in a food chain is known as a trophic level. The food chain also explains the feeding pattern or relationship between living organisms.</p>

<p>Trophic level refers to the sequential stages in a food chain, starting with producers at the bottom, followed by primary, secondary and tertiary consumers. The population of species in a food chain is shown using a pyramid of numbers. The food chain also explains the feeding pattern or relationship between living organisms. For example, grass produces its own food from sunlight. The study of groups of organisms is called synecology.</p>
