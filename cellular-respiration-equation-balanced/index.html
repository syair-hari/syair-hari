<p>In what cell structure does photosynthesis occur?. Chemically the process is different, as sugar is used as the main source of energy to create respiration. C 6 h 12 o 6 + 6 o 2 → 6 co 2 + 6 h 2 o + heat + 38 atp heat is not an element, but the fact that it is given off during aerobic respiration results from energy in the chemical bonds of the glucose and oxygen molecules escaping into the environment. The reaction requires energy in the form of light to overcome the activation energy needed for the reaction to proceed.

<p>How is this possible, since it violates the law of conservation of mass because it is unbalanced? The balanced chemical equation (formula) for cellular respiration. The reaction requires energy in the form of light to overcome the activation energy needed for the reaction to proceed. The balanced chemical equation for anaerobic respiration is: Anaerobic cellular respiration anaerobic cellular respiration is the process by which all organisms use c6h12o6 to make co2 and 2 atp.</p>
