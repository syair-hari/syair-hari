<p>Amphibians do not have scales and their skin is permeable (molecules and gases can pass through). Water is absorbed through their skin. Amphibians do not have scales, feathers, or even hair like other animals. Mammals are animals that give birth to their young and their bodies are always warm. An amphibian is unable to adjust its own body temperature, and is reliant on its environment to attain the correct body temperature.</p>
