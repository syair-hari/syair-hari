The bible teaches that out of all the creatures on earth, only a limited number of humans will go to heaven. According to many of them, yes, animals probably do go to heaven. Lewis imaginatively addresses the question of animal immortality in his book the problem of pain.</p>

<p>The likelihood that animals will be in the age to come — and i think it is a likelihood — is based on isaiah 11 and isaiah 65. One argument suggests that animals, along with all of creation, will be restored to life in the resurrection. The bible makes it clear that the majority of people will not go to heaven—see matthew chapter 7, verses 13 and 14 (mat 7:13,14) for one example. However, we must remember that this was a vision given to the apostle john concerning christ’s judgment of the earth. They go to heaven and if you have any doubts, you can ask allah(swt) to let animals in heaven.</p>

<p>Comments off on do pets go to heaven? You can ask allah(swt) for anything. Suffice it to say that a lot of christians believe that pets do go to heaven and that there will be animals in heaven. Let’s take a look at the scriptures that relate to animals and what is said of them: A second objection to the idea that animals go to heaven, is the thought that animals can’t be saved from sin, because they can’t make a moral choice to believe in jesus christ.</p>
