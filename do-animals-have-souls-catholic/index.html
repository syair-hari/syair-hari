<p>Pope pius ix is among the first of the popes to fully address the issue of animals going to heaven, though not favorably. They have spirits but not the equivalent of human souls. 24 and god said, let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds—livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds. and it was so. The following is an excerpt from askfrfrancis.org. It's just that people don't really pay attention to animals and so they write them off as inferior. Christ died to save the souls of human beings, not animals.</p>
<h3 id="first-the-catholic-church-does-not-teach-that-animals-do-not-have-souls">First, the catholic church does not teach that animals do not have souls.</h3><p>Animals and plants can’t do anything which transcends the limitations of matter. Personally, however, i believe they do, and also believe that, if there is a heaven, they go there just as children and infants do, because all of them are innocent. Human beings have human souls, dogs have dog souls, cats have cat souls and so forth. There is no difference between an animal's soul and a human's soul. The church has always taught that god created man and woman in his image and likeness with dominion over sea creatures, animals, bugs, etc. I think the fundamental difference between the animals and humans is not the soul, but the presence of a spirit.i think that distinction can be derived from genesis 1 (kjv):.</p>

<p>This harmonizes with a common new age idea that souls get to choose the body in which they. The souls that animals have are entirely dependent on their material makeup. Pope francis sent ripples around the world wednesday when he suggested that pets and other animals have a place in heaven, which is in stark contradiction to conservative catholic teaching that animals don't have souls. And keeping in mind that animals may not have immortal souls and thus this life might be all they have, would actually, i feel, inspire us to be nicer to animals and make this life as nice as we can for them and not do things like euthanize them when they become inconvenient etc. Does this answer sound like something out of the new age movement?</p>

Pope francis sent ripples around the world wednesday when he suggested that pets and other animals have a place in heaven, which is in stark contradiction to conservative catholic teaching that animals don't have souls. Do all living things have the same type of soul? Therefore, all animals that die before the advent of christ’s second coming will not exist in the new heaven and new earth. And keeping in mind that animals may not have immortal souls and thus this life might be all they have, would actually, i feel, inspire us to be nicer to animals and make this life as nice as we can for them and not do things like euthanize them when they become inconvenient etc.</p>

<p>Animals too have souls, just like men during a public audience in 1990, the holy father affirmed that the animals, like men, were given the 'breath of life' by god. All animals including humans have soul and our soul goes through different life forms until we purify it to become one with god. islam the general view is that animals do have souls. Do pets / animals have souls / spirits? answer: The reason you can have this hope is because from the very beginning of time, in the original state of holiness (the garden of eden) it appears there were animals. The soul is the principle of life.</p>
