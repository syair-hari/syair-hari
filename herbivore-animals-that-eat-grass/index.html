<p>A herbivore is an animal anatomically and physiologically adapted to eating plant material, for example foliage or marine algae, for the main component of its diet.as a result of their plant diet, herbivorous animals typically have mouthparts adapted to rasping or grinding. Humans eat both plants and animals. For example, people can eat fruit, salad, or nuts and poultry, turkey or beef. Animals that eat plants are called herbivores. But some herbivorous animals will eat eggs and occasionally other animal protein.</p>
