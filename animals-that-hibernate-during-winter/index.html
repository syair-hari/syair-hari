During the winter many animals struggle to survive, battling the cold, wind &amp; rain and food is much harder to find. These include turtles, frogs, salamanders and snakes. Other hibernating animals do not experience major changes in temperature, heart rate and breathing.</p>

<p>Other hibernating animals do not experience major changes in temperature, heart rate and breathing. In new york state, black bears, woodchucks (sometimes called groundhogs), jumping mice , and some bats such as the little brown bat are mammals that hibernate. They stay inactive and generally sleep through the hibernation period, to wake up once again when summer knocks at. During winter, if the den becomes too cold to live, raccoon may instead come out and search for any other warmer place. Certain species of fish, amphibians, and insects also survive the cold months of winter through the process of hibernation.</p>

<p>Some animals really do hibernate in winter. Bumblebees usually travel in colonies of 50 to 500, which is led by the queen in charge of the colony. According to the virtual nature trail, one den in canada was the hibernation spot for more than 8,000 snakes. These include turtles, frogs, salamanders and snakes. There are only 4 species of bear that are hibernators including american black bear, asiatic black bear, brown bear, and polar bear.</p>
