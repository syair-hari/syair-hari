<p>You’ll probably have noticed a lack of frog, toad and newt activity in autumn and early winter, and they do in fact become dormant during these months for survival. It uses very little energy. The animal's body temperature drops, and its heartbeat and breathing slow down. Tegus, lizards native to brazil, can spend up to six months underground during the cool, dry winters. Avoid disturbing the bin between autumn and april, when all species will have finished their long snooze.</p>
