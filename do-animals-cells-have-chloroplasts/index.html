<p>Chloroplasts are the food producers of thecell. Chloroplasts come in various shapes, with many of them shaped like disks. Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have their own dna. Animal cells have mitochondria and not chloroplasts because chloroplasts are a vital piece of the cell that plants need. Oxygen is released out from the chlorophyll while making food and this food is used by the plants themselves too. The cells of animals lack cell walls, chloroplasts and vacuoles which are all found in plant cells;</p>

<p>Animal cells do not need the chloroplasts because they do not undergo photosynthesis, and i'm pretty sure the cells wall hinders cell splitting or something and that's why they don't have it. Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have their own dna. It would be treated as a foreign molecule and will be digested.

<p>Plants cells have chloroplasts because they need it for a process called photosynthesis. Chloroplasts are small organelles, located in some plant cells, that contain chlorophyll and enable photosynthesis. Unfortunately, what is not usually conveyed well to students is that plant cells also have. Chloroplasts are the structures that give leaves their green color and, more importantly, allow plants to acquire their energy from the sun rather than from food, the primary source of energy for animals. Plant cells have some specialized properties that make them distinct from animal cells.</p>

<p>Only plant cells have them. Chloroplasts perform photosynthesis, so only cells that can make their own food from sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water require chloroplasts. But both plant and animal cells have mitochondria. Furthermore, most animals can move, and this capability is an enormous advantage when it comes to feeding, finding a mate and escaping from predators. Since animals don’t get their energy through photosynthesis (they get it from the food they eat), they don’t need chloroplasts.</p>

<p>Plant cells have some specialized properties that make them distinct from animal cells. Chloroplasts are the bits which store the chlorophyll in plants (the chlorophyll is what makes plants green, and is what absorbs sunlight for photosynthesis) so no, animal cells do not have chloroplasts. Humans and animals dont have chloroplasts in their cells. Chloroplasts are the structures that give leaves their green color and, more importantly, allow plants to acquire their energy from the sun rather than from food, the primary source of energy for animals. They do not need the rigid network that cell walls provide to stand upright.</p>

<p>Animal cells also lack cell walls. The onion is a photosynthetic plant, and it holds numerous chloroplasts in the leaves, which receive much more sunlight, but very few in other parts of the plant. If you inject the chloroplast into an animal cell then it would not survive because of two reasons: Animal cells do not have chloroplasts; Animal cells don't have chloroplasts because they don't need to photosynthesis as they get the glucose they need to respire from the food they eat.</p>

<p>For animals, height may be an advantage sometimes as well, but most animals have skeletons and musculature. In plant cells, chloroplasts assist the plants in performing photosynthesis. Humans and animals dont have chloroplasts in their cells. No, animal cells don't have cloroplasts. Chloroplasts are present in photosynthetic plants and is responsible for making the food of the plant.</p>

<p>Animal cells don't have chloroplasts because they don't need to photosynthesis as they get the glucose they need to respire from the food they eat. See elysia chlorotica whose cells actively take up chloroplasts and use them, and keep them alive (though not replicating). Oxygen is released out from the chlorophyll while making food and this food is used by the plants themselves too. Chlorophyll traps light energy which is converted to chemical potential energy in food made by the plant. Animal cells do not have chloroplasts.</p>

<p>What's more, euglena cells have flagellum, tails on cells which allow the cells to move and are characteristics of animal cells. The organelles are only found in plantcells and some protists such as algae.animal cells do not have chloroplasts. In plant cells, the cell wall gives the cell a rigid. Only plants and some protists or protozoa have chloroplasts. Humans and animals dont have chloroplasts in their cells.</p>
