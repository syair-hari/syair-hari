In a typical food chain, plants are eaten by herbivores, which are then eaten by carnivores. A food chain is a linear network of links in a food web starting from producer organisms (such as grass or trees which use radiation from the sun to make their food) and ending at apex predator species (like grizzly bears or killer whales), detritivores (like earthworms or woodlice), or decomposer species (such as fungi or bacteria).

Regarded as the chronological pathway, the food chain is a linear arrangement or series of organisms that are capable of eating one another so that the essential nutrients and energy flow from one living organism to the next one. In a typical food chain, plants are eaten by herbivores, which are then eaten by carnivores.

<p>Energy flow and primary productivity. A feeding hierarchy in which organisms in an ecosystem are grouped into trophic (nutritional) levels and are shown in a succession to represent the flow of food energy and the feeding relationships between them. Food may be derived from another living thing through predation, parasitism, etc. Food chains intertwine locally into a food web because most organisms consume more than one type of animal or plant. A food chain begins with a producer, usually a green plant or alga that creates its own food through photosynthesis.</p>
