<p><strong>Herbivores Plant Eating Animals</strong>. Examples of herbivores, as shown in figure 1 include vertebrates like deer, koalas, and some bird species, as well as invertebrates such as crickets and caterpillars. Many animals that eat fruit and leaves sometimes eat other parts of plants, for example roots and seeds. Herbivore incisors are sharp for tearing plants, but they may not be present on both the upper and lower jaw.

<p>Plant eaters are herbivores, meat eaters are carnivores, and animals that eat both plants and animals are omnivores. But some herbivorous animals will eat eggs and occasionally other animal protein. Herbivores have teeth that are adapted to grind vegetable tissue. A herbivore is an animal anatomically and physiologically adapted to eating plant material, for example foliage or marine algae, for the main component of its diet. They do not eat the flesh of other animals. These animals have evolved digestive systems capable of handling large amounts of plant material.</p>

Black rhinoceroses also eat a variety of fruits, branches, and leaves. As a result of their plant diet, herbivorous animals typically have mouthparts adapted to rasping or grinding. Herbivores are animals or insects who feed on vegetation such as leaves, grasses, roots, fruits, bulbs, leaves, and vegetables. Some animals are frugivores because they eat mainly fruit. Some herbivores, such as caterpillars, eat only one kind of plant, while others, such as elephants, eat the shoots, flowers, fruits, and leaves of a wide variety of plants.</p>
