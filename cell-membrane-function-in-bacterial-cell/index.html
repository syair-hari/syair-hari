<p>All cells have an outer plasma membrane that regulates not only what enters the cell, but also how much of any given substance comes in. The plasma membrane or bacterial cytoplasmic membrane is composed of a phospholipid bilayer and thus has all of the general functions of a cell membrane such as acting as a permeability barrier for most molecules and serving as the location for the transport of molecules into the cell. The cell membrane also helps regulate the growth of the cell, by controlling the processes of exocytosis and endocytosis.

<p>The cell membrane is a multifaceted membrane that envelopes a cell's cytoplasm. Thick protective cell wall is present covering the whole cell. Representative images from a single replicate out of three independent replicates are shown. Cell is isolated and independent. Structure, function &amp; types next lesson bacterial cytoplasm &amp; cell membrane:</p>

<p>Proteins and lipids are the major components of the cell membrane. It is present just above the cell membrane and gives a specific shaped to the cell. In bacterial and plant cells, a cell wall is attached to the plasma membrane on its outside surface. It is selectively permeable as it allows to pass selective substances such as sugar, aminoacids across it. These include the cytoplasm and cell membrane.</p>

<p>This will also help you to draw the structure and diagram of plasma membrane. Human cells are in a group and not isolated. It is a selectively permeable cell organelle,allowing certain substances inside the cell while preventing others to pass through and thus is analogous to a barrier or gatekeeper in their function. It is present just above the cell membrane and gives a specific shaped to the cell. Representative images from a single replicate out of three independent replicates are shown.</p>
