<p>Menstruation has been found in four bat species in two families, phyllostomidae and molossidae, and elephant shrews/sengis, relatives of elephants and aardvarks. How do females of a species not attract predators to the signal of menstrual blood? It is similar to a woman's menstrual cycle except that it only happens twice a year. Researchers determined back in 2005 that chimpanzees share somewhere between 98.6 and 99 percent of our dna. If evolution really occures, then animals should have menstruated and humans womb lining should have absorbed in the body demanding a cleaner and facilitating life to the humans than animals. A menstrual cycle is most common in primates.</p>
<h3 id="evolution-means-change-over-time">Evolution means change over time.</h3><p>Other primates, such as tarsiers, may menstruate, but there is no firm evidence. It would seem that it would then be a disadvantage to evolutionary survival for female organisms to menstruate. We get the urge because our ancestors did too, even back to the earliest mammals and reptiles. Animals are definitely intuitive, in what seems like a whole different way from humans. During that time you might notice that your dog's vulva is swollen and she will exhibit a discharge that can be red or yellow. Humans, apes, monkeys, bats and elephant shrews.</p>

<p>Instead, the lining is reabsorbed if fertilization does not occur. Menstruation has been found in four bat species in two families, phyllostomidae and molossidae, and elephant shrews/sengis, relatives of elephants and aardvarks. It produces the female egg cells necessary for reproduction, called the ova or oocytes. Menstruation, also known as a period or monthly, is the regular discharge of blood and mucosal tissue (known as menses) from the inner lining of the uterus through the vagina. They're closer to humans than they are to gorillas!</p>

<p>It seems the list of animals that menstruate is quite short: All mammals have a menstrual cycle. Men are not only good listeners when it comes to distinguishing the period voice, but they also have a keen sense of smell — at least when it comes to a woman’s menstrual cycle. It seems the list of animals that menstruate is quite short: Scientists have long known that animals' fertility and reproductive success slowly decline with increasing age — a phenomenon called reproductive senescence.but, for the most part, reproduction.</p>

<p>Even among those that give birth to live young as we do, only a handful of species menstruate. Sometimes this involves a bit of blood. It’s likely that as soon as animals evolved brain circuitry. Great apes like humans and chimpanzees, lesser apes like siamang and lar gibbon, and other mammals like bats. As anyone with a dog or cat knows, those fluffy companions sometimes have a way of just knowing when you.</p>

<p>But most of them have a covert menstruation. During that time you might notice that your dog's vulva is swollen and she will exhibit a discharge that can be red or yellow. Female dogs do not menstruate in the way that women do. In animals with an estrous cycle, it is reabsorbed. Humans, apes, monkeys, bats and elephant shrews.</p>

<p>These hormones are responsible for developing and maintaining female sexual traits, as well as maintaining a pregnancy. The first period usually begins between twelve and fifteen years of age, a point in time known as menarche. A new study finds that it all comes down to their unique social structures. This phase starts when an egg from the previous cycle isn’t fertilized. It seems the list of animals that menstruate is quite short:</p>

<p>All mammals have a menstrual cycle. This phase starts when an egg from the previous cycle isn’t fertilized. We've created a list to show you exactly which animals are more like brothers, and which are only cousins on the evolutionary family tree. Homemade or commercial dog cycle pads can be a way of dealing with a dog's discharge when she's in season. It would seem that it would then be a disadvantage to evolutionary survival for female organisms to menstruate.</p>
