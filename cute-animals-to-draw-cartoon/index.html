<p>Make sure the head is wider than the body. So don’t worry if you can’t draw, all you can do is just following this step by step instruction. But you can still manage to draw a cute animal with simple eyes, like the tiger (4) who has two dots instead of circles for the eyes. Next, draw the antlers using multiple broken lines.
