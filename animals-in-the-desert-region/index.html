It is one of earth’s major types of ecosystems, supporting a community of plants and animals specially adapted to the harsh environment. This spacing gives some desert regions a desolate appearance. Most animals avoid being out in the sun during the hottest part of the day. American indians were the first humans in the california desert.</p>

<p>Thus, adaptations of desert animals are actually the adjustments to protect themselves against high temperatures, to live without water, and to conserve water as far as possible. Desert biomes are characterized by the presence of animals and plants which need minimal moisture for their survival. Distinct desert areas are determined on the basis of the species of plants growing in a particular desert region. Animals in the desert must survive in a hostile environment. Deserts around the world vary in the types of animals they offer.</p>

<p>Deserts are often defined as areas that receive less than 10 inches of average annual rainfall. Many desert animals, such as the fennec fox, are nocturnal, coming out to hunt only when the brutal sun has descended. It has a large and flat beak and their eyes have long eyelashes. Distinct desert areas are determined on the basis of the species of plants growing in a particular desert region. Deserts (especially true deserts) are not easy places for animals to live.</p>
