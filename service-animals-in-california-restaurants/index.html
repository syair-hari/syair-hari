<p>Service animals are working animals that have been trained to perform tasks that assist disabled people. Several different california laws set out the rights of people with disabilities who use animals to assist them. Service animals may also be referred to as assistance animals, assist animals, or helper animals depending on the country and the animal's function. California state law (csl) service animals are allowed in dining and sales areas “not used for food preparation” only, and employees with service animals must wash their hands after handling the animal.

<p>Accordingly, restaurants must allow individuals with disabilities to bring their service dogs onto the business premise in all areas customers are generally allowed or the public is invited (even if the restaurant has a “no pets” policy or animals are prohibited by state or local health codes). Service animals are defined as dogs that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities. Service animals are also allowed in cafeterias such as those found in the workplace or on school campuses. The laws in california allow a person with a disability to bring a trained service dog or psychiatric service dog to all public places but not emotional support animals. If they meet this definition, animals are considered service animals under the ada regardless of whether they have been licensed or certified by a state or local government.</p>

<p>Special rule for service animals: Service animals may also be referred to as assistance animals, assist animals, or helper animals depending on the country and the animal's function. Accordingly, restaurants must allow individuals with disabilities to bring their service dogs onto the business premise in all areas customers are generally allowed or the public is invited (even if the restaurant has a “no pets” policy or animals are prohibited by state or local health codes). Some states may also allow for mixed support of emotional support animals. The california retail food code generally prohibits animals within food facilities with the exception of service animals and law enforcement animals.</p>
