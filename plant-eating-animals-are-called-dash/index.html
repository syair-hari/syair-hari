Eating grass is called grazing. Avoid added fats and sugars. This is the exact reason why herbivorous animals possess a longer intestine than carnivorous animals. Rabbit and goat are herbivores.

<p>Autotrophs and heterotrophs do cellular respiration to break down food to transfer the energy from food to atp. The apex predators return energy to the food web after they die and their bodies are consumed by scavengers, fungi and microbes. Eat whole plants such as grains, nuts, vegetables, and fruit. Tofu, for example, has often been treated as an alternative to meat for centuries. Animals need food to live and grow.</p>
