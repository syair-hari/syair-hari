<p>Scientists want to bring it back. One of the most popular candidates for resurrection, and for good reason, is the woolly mammoth. Last week, scientists met to discuss which animals should be up for consideration. This might complicate our âwhich came firstâ question. Theyâve also made great advances in gene editing and genome sequencing.</p>

<p>The iconic birds vanished from massachusetts lakes decades ago. Scientists could retrieve dna from some of his iconic quiff, sequence his full genetic code, edit the âgenetic essenceâ of elvis into a regular human cell and then use that to create a cloned baby. Below is a list of ten animals that the scientists are attempting to bring back to life from their conserved dna in fossilized remains. \r\r mail online\r\r.\rthe jurassic park scientist who plans to turn a chicken into t rex\r\r\rdinosaur embryos.

<p>This might complicate our âwhich came firstâ question. Below is a list of ten animals that the scientists are attempting to bring back to life from their conserved dna in fossilized remains. In fact, scientists are already working on resurrecting a variety of them, ranging from wooly mammoths to passenger pigeons. Scientists want to bring them back through selective breeding of cattle species that carry some aurochs dna. In relatively recent times, scientists have discovered remarkably intact remains of extinct species.</p>
