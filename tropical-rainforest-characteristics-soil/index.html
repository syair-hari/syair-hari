<p>Tropical rainforests experience this tropical climate, a climate without any dry season. Analyses were made of soils from six pits to determine several physical and chemical properties of the topsoil of the lowland forest and ginger belt zones. Buttress roots stretch from the ground to two or more meters up the tree, helping to anchor the tree to the ground. Because of the lack of seasonal differences, due to the geographical location of the forests, and the high humidity level the vegetation is luxuriant here. Within the world wildlife fund's biome.</p>
