A food chain demonstrates the energy flow among the organisms that live in the arctic tundra. Tundra food chain conclusion take a look at my tundra food chain. There are also beetles and butterflies. Food chains intersect to form food webs.</p>

The arctic owls, foxes, and wolves are the next powerful,and the most common things they eat are arctic hairs,caribou, and pikas. Out of all the biomes existing in the world, tundra is the coldest. Climate change appears to be causing permafrost to thaw, changing the ecological balance in the tundra and threatening some animals that live in this wild landscape. Caribou moss is eaten by caribou , and lichens are eaten by lemmings and arctic hares.

As you can see livernorts are geting eaten by pikas ,grasses are being eaten by pikas,musk ox, caribou, lemmings ,and brown bears.
