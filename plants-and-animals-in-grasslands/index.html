<p>The plants and animals that live in grasslands are connected through an unlimited web of interactions. Grassland, area in which the vegetation is dominated by a nearly continuous cover of grasses. Various names of temperate grasslands include pampas, downs, and veldts. Plants are the only living organism that can produce food. These plants often survive wildfires due to fact that their stems and buds grow underground.</p>

<p>Grassland biomes are found in the middle latitudes and in the interiors of continents. Animals and plants inhabiting this natural wonder. Grasslands are large, flat, treeless areas of land covered with grass. Any list of grassland plants is sure to include plenty of grasses since they make up the majority of the area's vegetation. Vegetation on the african savannas, for example, feeds animals including zebras, wildebeest, gazelles, and giraffes.</p>

<p>In the grasslands where grass is the main plant found in the ecosystem, it is eaten by hundreds of other. The prairies contained more than 80 species of animals and 300 species of birds, and hundreds of species of plants. Vegetation on the african savannas, for example, feeds animals including zebras, wildebeest, gazelles, and giraffes. Plants and animals living in the grasslands must be able to adapt to the lack of trees and heavy brush for shelter as well as the seasonal drought and limited rainfall. In temperate grasslands, though, there are also quite a few wildflowers, whereas tropical grasslands are home to many trees that are uniquely adapted to the grassland biome.</p>
