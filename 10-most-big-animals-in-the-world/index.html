<p>:) oyewole folarin from lagos on august 06, 2014: It is one of the most incredible marine animals and loves. It could be climate change, lack of food, lack of space to live or any major disaster like getting hit by an asteroid. They should be higher than #10, but we should be glad that they at least got in the top ten! They come into new spaces and push out other animals and plants by generally wreaking havoc.</p>
