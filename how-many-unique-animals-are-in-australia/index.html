<p>Native animals are animals that are indigenous to, or come from, a specific country. This is one of the coolest animals in australia, since it’s such a unique, powerful, and dangerous animal. Those 2,000 miles contain thousands of islands that act as stepping stones toward the timor, banda and arafura seas—but it’s still an awfully long way for plants, animals and people to migrate. Some can only be found in certain areas, some are easily seen in the wild life, and some are favourites of our zoos. Here the list of 9 amazing australian animals.</p>
