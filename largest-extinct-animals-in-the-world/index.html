<p>Elephants are megafauna, as are giraffes, whales, cows, deer, tigers, and even humans. They weighed up to 700kg. The largest animal that ever lived is the blue whale. It might come as a surprise that the largest animal ever recorded still lives today, although it is on the endangered species list. It is our duty to provide the appropriate care for the welfare of these animals.</p>
