<p>“all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.” ― george orwell, animal farm. Animals, equal, more, others, some, than quotes to explore i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. The ultimate example of the pigs’ systematic abuse of logic and language to control their underlings, this final reduction of the seven commandments, which appears in chapter x, clothes utterly senseless content in a seemingly plausible linguistic form. In recent years a number of oppressed groups have campaigned vigorously for equality. All animals are equal one of the strongest pleas for the rights and liberation of animals, following the success of various liberation movements of humanity, has been peter singer's all animals are equal, an important article dealing with the need for the liberation of all animals.</p>

This idea is supported given the fact that it is one pig (), alone, who puts the idea of rebellion. This phrase has been used by george orwell in his phenomenal novel animal farm.this is, in fact, one of the seven commandments for the animal farm pigs reinterpreted to be read as “all animals are equal / but some animals are more equal than others.” this phrase is an ultimate example of the systematic abuse of language and logic of pigs, with the intention.
