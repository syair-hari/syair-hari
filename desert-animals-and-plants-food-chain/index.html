<h3 id="-insectivores-eat-only-insects">• insectivores eat only insects.</h3><p>• omnivores eat plants and animals. The next level contains the plant eaters which include squirrels, grass grazers, and insects. Simultaneously, the plants depend totally on the unpredictable desert environment: The plants, also known as the producers, capture energy from the sun and start the process of photosynthesis all plants from shrubs to cacti use the suns energy as food. • decomposers break down organic matter. If the population of the jackal somehow decreases, and predation from this species decreases as a result, the original prey population will increase due to the lack of predation and organisms lower on the food chain such as certain types of plants will decrease.</p>
