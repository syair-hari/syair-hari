The metabolic pathway involved in respiration can be split into three main parts: Here the throat divides into the trachea (windpipe) and oesophagus (food pipe). Photosynthesis involves the use of energy from sunlight water and carbon dioxide. Two unlabeled slides are viewed under a microscope.</p>

<p>If oxygen present, the pyruvate may break down all the way to carbon dioxide in cellular respiration, to make any atp molecule. There is also a small flap of cartilage called the epiglottis which prevents food from entering the trachea If oxygen present, the pyruvate may break down all the way to carbon dioxide in cellular respiration, to make any atp molecule. Likewise, “biological machines” also require well engineered parts and good energy source in order to work.perhaps the second most important molecule (dna is the first) is adenosine triphosphate (also known as atp).basically, atp serves as the main energy currency of the cell. Account for all electron carriers and atp molecules produced.</p>
