<p><strong>Are Humans Animals Quora</strong>. Our ancestors roamed the land in search of food by day, and huddled together for safety by night. Humans are unusual animals by any stretch of the imagination. We live firmly in the kingdom “animalia”, and are related very closely with other animals as part of the family of great apes. For instance, even a lion hunting to kill an antelope does so out of an instinctive necessity for food, and not out of a will to express power and dominance over the antelope.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of years ago, humans were wild animals. Throughout history humans have created a seemingly impenetrable barrier between us and other animals. We are members of the phylum chordata, the class mammalia, the order primates, the infraorder simiiformes, the family hominidae, the subfamily homininae, the tribe hominini, the genus homo, and the species sapiens. We are not bacteria, viruses, archeobacteria or fungi (most of us). This means that the humans walk around using their two rear limbs. As the philosopher rene descartes wrote in the late 1600s:</p>
<h3 id="humans-can-generate-a-practically-limitless-variety-of-words-and-concepts">Humans can generate a practically limitless variety of words and concepts.</h3><p>Will humans go extinct if all other animals die? Why can animals stomach impure water while humans are prone to infections? To make these glands more efficient, human bodies had to lose their hair to better dissipate heat. Humans are the only animals with obviously visible eye whites, with irises that are much more prominent and therefore readable. Most all animals are capable of it… including you. Will humans go extinct if all other animals die?</p>

<p>The notion that humans have souls, but animals do not, was (and still is for some) a popular belief. Humans also have an abundance of sweat glands, called eccrine glands. We don’t need to be physically strong, because we use weapons which multiply our strength. This means that the humans walk around using their two rear limbs. Yes, spiders can be killed.</p>

<p>Usually an average healthy adult human weighs about 50 to 80 kilograms while the height could vary within 1.5 and 1.8 metres. Just poke it with your finger. It's classic come at me, bro showmanship. This means that the humans walk around using their two rear limbs. Are we animals or humans?</p>

<p>We can easily tell where someone is looking and often what someone is thinking. Will humans go extinct if all animals die? We are not bacteria, viruses, archeobacteria or fungi (most of us). We don’t give them a chance humans are social animals that are really good at being. Of course, humans are animals, but there must be one or two characteristics that distinguish us as unique from the rest of the animal kingdom:</p>

<p>Modern man is of mainly three types; Humans aren't always reliable caretakers, so domestic animals are usually capable of surviving in a wide range of conditions, eating garbage and going without food or water for some time.

<p>We do so through two modes of operation recursive and combinatorial. The notion that humans have souls, but animals do not, was (and still is for some) a popular belief. Your question, reworded as a statement, contains a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. Humans rank in between, with a 1.4kg (3lbs) brain and give or take 86 billion neurons. This means that the humans walk around using their two rear limbs.</p>

<p>Well, as i’m sure you know by saying “most,” some animals will happily attack and eat humans, such as crocodiles. But in many animals the whites of the eye, known as the sclera, aren’t white at all but are pigmented, making the iris hard to distinguish. Why are humans the only species on this planet that drink milk from another lactating species well past two years of age? Our ancestors roamed the land in search of food by day, and huddled together for safety by night. Just to clarify, these animals can possibly be defeated by an unarmed human, but may not be plausible.</p>
