Grasslands are regions on earth in which the dominant plants are grasses. Depending on the latitude of the temperate grassland, they often experience long, hot. One of the most interesting biomes on the planet, the grassland biome is spread across six of the seven continents of the world. Despite this unforgiving environment, there are many plants and animals that live in temperate grasslands. It is a flat area that has periods of drought and thin soil so that trees cannot survive.</p>
<h3 id="the-plants-in-grasslands-offer-a-wide-variety-of-resources-for-the-birds-animals-and">The plants in grasslands offer a wide variety of resources for the birds, animals and.</h3><p>Some animals that inhabit temperate grasslands in north america are bison, antelope, birds, gophers, prairie dogs, coyotes, and insects. Oak trees in general are adaptable to a variety of different environments. The grassland ecosystems can be found in both tropical and temperate regions of the world, though the specific ecosystems will vary slightly. Oaks also produce fruits, known as acorn. Because of extreme heat, savanna plants have large trunks to store water during these dry seasons. Temperate grasslands are located in cold, dry climate regions.</p>

<p>Temperate grasslands are home to many large and small herbivores. Apart from grazers and predators, the temperate grasslands are also home to small animal species. Grasslands can be difficult environments for plants, so many of these plants have had to adapt. Because the temperate biome has four distinct seasons, animals spend much of the growing season preparing for winter. The decay of roots produces a deep, dark, coherent soil rich in nutrients and with fertile upper layers.</p>
