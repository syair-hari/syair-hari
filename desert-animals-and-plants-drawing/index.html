It is one of earth’s major types of ecosystems, supporting a community of plants and animals specially adapted to the harsh environment. Welcome to the tutorial to draw camel. Many desert animals (and plants) show especially clear evolutionary adaptations for water conservation or heat tolerance and so are often studied in comparative physiology, ecophysiology, and evolutionary physiology. Deserts, however, are not deserted.</p>

<p>Let’s explore the special animals and plants that call the desert home with this vividly colored desert plants and animals worksheet! Fennec foxes feed on plants and desert animals. The desert is “a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life.” deserts are typically hot and dry, and some are known for sand dunes or dangerous sand storms. Some plants also have corrugated surfaces with longitudinal grooves and ridges. Deserts (especially true deserts) are not easy places for animals to live.</p>

<p>Desert, any large, extremely dry area of land with sparse vegetation. Xerocole animals include mammals like sheep, sand cats, kangaroo rats and antelope, scorpions, lizards and snakes like the sidewinder, as well as the roadrunner and more. We are not so interested on the animals that live on deserts instead of that we talk more about the animals living on jungles. There is no end to how helpful plants are or the interesting facts about them. Because living things need water to survive, deserts are home to relatively few plants and animals.</p>
