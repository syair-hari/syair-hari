<p>The climate in the trf is hot and humid, with varying levels of precipitation and temperature throughout the year. A tropical rainforest climate or equatorial climate is a tropical climate usually found within 10 to 15 degrees latitude of the equator, and has at least 60 millimetres of rainfall every month of the year. A forest that grows in a tropical area with high rainfall. The tropical rainforest can be found in the planet’s area that is located near to the equator (10 degrees north and 10 degrees south of the equator) and is known as the area of the tropical rainforest climate where is no dry season (each month the average precipitation reaches the value of at least 60 mm). Nearly all tropical rainforests are located below the equator, in or near the tropic of capricorn (23.5° south of the equator).</p>

<p>Forests in tropical and temperate regions have a cooling effect, whereas boreal forests found in high northern latitudes make their climate warmer. The graph illustrates the climate in manaus, brazil, in the amazon rainforest. Tropical monsoon forests have a climate similar to tropical rainforests, except for rainfall patterns. The amazon rainforest is located in the upper section of brazil south of the equator. A tropical rainforest climate is typically hot, very humid, and wet.</p>
