<p>A food chain is a series of organisms where all the organismsare dependent on next organism as a source of food. A food web is made up of many different food chains. A food chain is the path by which energy passes from one living thing to another. The food chain can be said as the straight and single pathway for the flow of energy in an ecosystem, through different species of organisms.food web, on the other hand, is defined as the convoluted or complicated pathway of an ecosystem consist of numerous food chains of the different trophic level, through which the energy flow. Different levels in the food chain are called trophic level. From the food chain, we get to know how organisms are connected with each other.</p>
<h3 id="occasionally-a-single-organism-is-consumed-by-many-predators-or-it-consumes-several-other-organisms">Occasionally, a single organism is consumed by many predators or it consumes several other organisms.</h3><p>A food chain is a flow of energy from a green plant (producer) to an animal (consumer) and to another animal (another consumer) and so on. Food chain follows a single path whereas food web follows multiple paths. Different levels in the food chain are called trophic level. It is introduced generally in class 3 science and students get to explore it in detail further till class 9th. Vocab definition add this now to your vocab book food chain: Each step or division in food chain which is characterized by a particular method of obtaining food is called trophic level.</p>
