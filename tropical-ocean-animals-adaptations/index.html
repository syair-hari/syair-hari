<p>Adaptations for survival in the sea explores some of the adaptations used by various sea creatures to survive. Describe the unique conditions in a tropical rainforest ; This seaweed is a food source for fish and marine animals and is harvested, in some places, as a human food source as well. Fish have fins and those help them swim faster, fish also are certain colors to camoflouge themselves.most mammals in the ocean, such as whales have blubber to provide warmth. For example, some animals use camoflage to escape detection or to sneak up on their prey, while other animals have coloration which intentionally makes them stand out. Endangered animals in the ocean;</p>
