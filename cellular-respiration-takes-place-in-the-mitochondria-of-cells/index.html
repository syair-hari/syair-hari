<p>There are enzymes for krebs cycle in the mitochondrial matrix. This process produces energy within the cell. Prokaryotic cells carry out cellular respiration within the cytoplasm or on the inner surfaces of the cells. It is the process in which the oxidation of the carbohydrate molecule, glucose, takes place in the presence of oxygen. Cellular respiration is the process of oxidizing food molecules, like glucose, to carbon dioxide and water. Biochemical pathway that completes the breakdwon of glucose in the mitochondria.</p>

<p>Cellular respiration takes place in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Before cellular respiration can occur, glucose is broken down in a cell’s cytoplasm during an anaerobic process called glycolysis. Cellular respiration is the process by which cells convert glucose into usable energy in the form of atp in the presence of oxygen and producing carbon dioxide in the process. The enzymatic reactions of cellular respiration begin in the cytoplasm, but most of the reactions occur in the mitochondria. This is the overall equation:</p>

Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that takes place in the cytosol of cells in all living organisms. C6h12o6(glucose) + 6o2 → 6co2 + 6h2o + ≈38 atp Compound made during anaerobic fermentation in muscle cells. This pathway can function with or without the presence of oxygen.</p>

<p>Cellular respiration is the process by which the living organism’s cells extract the energy stored in the chemical bonds of food molecules , especially sugars ( glucose ) that are manufactured by the plants or eaten by animals , then this energy is stored in the f orm of atp molecules to be use d in performing the different activities. Electrons carried by nadh and fadh2 are passed along a series of enzymes (the chain), releasing energy. The krebs cycle, which takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria. This organelle is central in respiration and is often called the. There are three main stages of cellular respiration:</p>

<p>Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert chemical energy from oxygen molecules or nutrients into adenosine triphosphate, and then release waste products. This process takes place in the mitochondria of a cell. Cellular respiration is the process by which the living organism’s cells extract the energy stored in the chemical bonds of food molecules , especially sugars ( glucose ) that are manufactured by the plants or eaten by animals , then this energy is stored in the f orm of atp molecules to be use d in performing the different activities.

<p>Cellular respiration is the aerobic process by which living cells break down glucose molecules, release energy, and form molecules of atp. This is the overall equation: Respiration happens in the cells of plants, animals and humans, mainly inside mitochondria, which are located in a cell’s cytoplasm. The electron transport occurs in the oxysomes of mitichondria. Hence, the main objective of this stage is to use the pyruvates to produce more atp.</p>

Aerobic during cellular respiration the other phases that take place inside the mitochondria where oxygen is the final acceptor of electrons nad+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) The three stages of aerobic cellular respiration are: However, most cells undergo pyruvate oxidation and continue to the other pathways of cellular respiration.</p>

<p>Before the cellular respiration can occur, an initial step, known as glycolysis, takes place outside the mitochondrion, in the cell cytoplasm. Glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and electron transport/oxidative phosphorylation. The enzymatic reactions of cellular respiration begin in the cytoplasm, but most of the reactions occur in the mitochondria. With a net gain of 2 atp only in the previous stage, that is ‘glycolysis’, there is the need to harvest more energy. The biochemical process that occurs in cells is known as cell respiration and when the process takes place in the presence of oxygen it is termed aerobic respiration if oxygen is absent then we can say that anaerobic respiration is taking place.</p>

<p>The energy currency of these cells is atp, and one way to view the outcome of cellular respiration is as a production process for atp. Cellular respiration takes place in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Cellular respiration is the process of oxidizing food molecules, like glucose, to carbon dioxide and water. The electron transport occurs in the oxysomes of mitichondria. According to hartnell college, cellular respiration takes place in the cytoplasm of cells and inside the mitochondria.</p>
