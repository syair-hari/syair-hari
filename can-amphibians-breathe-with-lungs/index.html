<p><strong>Can Amphibians Breathe With Lungs</strong>. Most lizards breathe through with their lungs. Amphibians (frogs, newts, salamanders etc) are not reptiles. The lungs of amphibians are very poorly developed and are simple saclike structures. Amphibians may breathe with lungs, gills or through their skin.</p>

<p>They don't have gills and if they swim underwater they have to come to the surface to breathe.(amphibians ( frogs. With the exception of a few frog species that lay eggs on land, all amphibians begin life as completely aquatic larvae. Amphibians may breathe with lungs, gills or through their skin. How do amphibians breathe using their lungs? Some species of salamander lack lungs and breathe eaither through their skin or through gills. Reptiles always breathe with lungs.</p>
<h3 id="most-adult-amphibians-breathe-using-their-lungs-and-through-cutaneous-respiration">Most adult amphibians breathe using their lungs and through cutaneous respiration.</h3><p>Some amphibians can hold their breath for hours. All mammals, birds, and reptiles and most adult amphibians breathe through lungs. Their lungs are powerful, and muscular with more surface area for gas exchange. Some that are aquatic and remain most of the time inside water can also respire using their papillae. Amphibians that can hold their breath for a very long time also exist. All reptiles are known to respire through their lungs.</p>

<p>There are a few amphibians that do not have lungs and only breathe through their skin. Most adult amphibians breathe using their lungs and through cutaneous respiration. Though in some reptiles the body is adapted to their respective environmental condition like the aquatic turtles developing permeable skin but the process of respiration is not completely. These specialised structures are present in organisms according to the environment the live in and that h. Reptiles do not have a larval stage like amphibians.</p>

<p>Some amphibians can stay for longer periods on land by breathing through lungs, while others need to go underwater after some time. They breathe through gills while they are tadpoles. The living amphibians (frogs, toads, salamanders, and caecilians) depend on aquatic respiration to a degree that varies with species, stage of development, temperature, and season. Cutaneous respiration means that they absorb oxygen directly. The reptiles include the snake, tortoise, lizards, crocodiles, etc.</p>

<p>The lungs of amphibians are very poorly developed and are simple saclike structures. Salamanders that can stay underwater indefinitely will crawl out to forage and mate or move from one body of water to a different one if the conditions in the former pool are bad. They also have fins to help them swim, just like fish. Amphibians have primitive lungs compared to reptiles, birds, or mammals. They breathe through gills while they are tadpoles.</p>

<p>Their lungs are powerful, and muscular with more surface area for gas exchange. They have tiny openings on the roof of their mouth called external nares that take in different scents directly into their mouths. Amphibians are able to breathe through the entire surface of their skin or through gills, depending on which set of respiratory system they were born with. With the exception of a few frog species that lay eggs on land, all amphibians begin life as completely aquatic larvae.

<p>Every organism requires a specialized organ to breathe, for example humans have lungs, fishes have gills, earthworms have skin for breathing. For example, some salamanders such as the mexican axolotl can breathe underwater using gills. Reptiles breathe air through their nostrils and their mouths into their lungs. How do amphibians breathe using their lungs? While all of these species breathe using lungs, there are some species that actually breathe through their skin or gills.</p>

<p>How do amphibians breathe using their lungs? Their skin has to stay wet in order for them to absorb oxygen so they secrete mucous to keep their skin moist (if they get too dry, they cannot breathe and will die). While all of these species breathe using lungs, there are some species that actually breathe through their skin or gills. They breathe through gills while they are tadpoles. From the tiniest hummingbird to the largest whale shark, they all breathe using their lungs.</p>

<p>Some species of salamander lack lungs and breathe eaither through their skin or through gills. Not all amphibians can breathe underwater. There are a few amphibians that do not have lungs and only breathe through their skin. Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class amphibia.all living amphibians belong to the group lissamphibia.they inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems.thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. Many amphibians can breathe underwater in one way or the other.</p>
