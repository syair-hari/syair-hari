<p>It can be hard to find food during the cold months so they will head south and come back when spring approaches. Visiting birds such as swallows gather to migrate abroad, while geese arrive from cold countries to overwinter here. Animals migrate to warmer climates to survive during the winter. I've just returned from bulgaria to see the autumn migration of raptors, storks and passerines. Frogs and newts will hibernate on the bottom of ponds, but if these ponds are full of leaf matter this can prove deadly to a hibernating amphibian if the pond freezes over. Other animals migrate in order to breed.</p>

<p>Some species travel here for the winter and others arrive in spring and summer. Across the world animals of all kinds migrate, ranging from huge whales to tiny insects. Some animals search for a cave to overwinter. This sleep is called hibernation. As the weather gets cooler, animals who live outside must prepare for winter.</p>

<p>Why animals are driven to migrate as the year turns, millions of birds and animals cross oceans and continents but climate change may have unpredictable consequences for this. Like we explored with our animal habitat project, animals either adapt to their surroundings or need to make a temporary move. âat the end of every summer, more than 100 million individuals. For example, swallows migrate south once the weather begins to cool and their food sources dwindle. 500 miles / 800km redwings rest in britain between october and march, feeding on berries in trees and hedgerows.</p>

Animals that find it hard to find food in winter or do not adapt well to cold temperatures will find a safe place and fall into a very deep sleep. Youâll probably have noticed a lack of frog, toad and newt activity in autumn and early winter, and they do in fact become dormant during these months for survival.</p>

<p>However, permanent migrations may also occur. Some species travel here for the winter and others arrive in spring and summer. Migration is part of the life cycle of these animals. To celebrate the arrival of this beautiful season, take a look at our favourite autumn animals. Check out our gallery of beautiful autumn animals!</p>

I can confirm it's a great place to see these species flooding south at this time of year. 500 miles / 800km redwings rest in britain between october and march, feeding on berries in trees and hedgerows. This movement is called migration.</p>
