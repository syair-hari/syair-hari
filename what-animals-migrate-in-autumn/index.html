Animals that find it hard to find food in winter or do not adapt well to cold temperatures will find a safe place and fall into a very deep sleep. You’ll probably have noticed a lack of frog, toad and newt activity in autumn and early winter, and they do in fact become dormant during these months for survival.</p>

<p>However, permanent migrations may also occur. Some species travel here for the winter and others arrive in spring and summer. Migration is part of the life cycle of these animals. To celebrate the arrival of this beautiful season, take a look at our favourite autumn animals. Check out our gallery of beautiful autumn animals!</p>

I can confirm it's a great place to see these species flooding south at this time of year. 500 miles / 800km redwings rest in britain between october and march, feeding on berries in trees and hedgerows. This movement is called migration.</p>
