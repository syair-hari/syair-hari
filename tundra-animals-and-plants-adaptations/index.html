It is also physical adaptations. Interesting info about its plants and animals. Bearberry is a low growing plant that uses that adaptation to stay out of the way of the ripping tundra wind.it also favors places like behind rocks to again stay out of the wind.the leathery leaves keeps moisture and heat inside the plant.</p>

<p>It is a very fragile environment and the plants and animals that have made their home on the tundra biome have made some incredible adaptations to the long, cold winters and the short but abundant summers. Until then, they remain dormant to preserve nutrients and moisture. Arctic tundra animals do not enjoy the luxury of simply heading into thick forests to escape the biting wind. Hibernation is a combination of behavioral and physical adaptations. Because animals of the tundra are generally migratory, this biome's population is.</p>
