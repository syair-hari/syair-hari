The fragile food chains of tundra support some of the most amazing species on the planet, including the likes of gray wolves, polar bears, snowy owls, and arctic foxes. A rabbit eats the grass. More specifically, a food chain describes the order in which matter and energy in the form of food are transferred from one organism to another. It allows them to pick a habitat of their choice and come up with a food chain based on the residing animals. The population of species in a food chain is shown using a pyramid of numbers.</p>

<p>A food chain is a linear network of links in a food web starting from producer organisms (such as grass or trees which use radiation from the sun to make their food) and ending at apex predator species (like grizzly bears or killer whales), detritivores (like earthworms or woodlice), or decomposer species (such as fungi or bacteria).a food chain also shows how the organisms are related with. A food chain always begins with producers. Coral reefs provide an excellent example of the trophic web since they are a biodiversity hotspot. No animal eats hyenas, cheetahs, or vultures.

<p>A food chain describes how different organisms eat each other, starting out with a plant and ending with an animal. A food chain always begins with producers. A food web is a who eats whom diagram that shows the complex feeding relationships for a particular ecosystem.
