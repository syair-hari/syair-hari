In bacterial and plant cells, a cell wall is attached to the plasma membrane on its outside surface. Subsequently, question is, what is the function of the cell membrane in an animal cell?

<p>In animal cells and in artificially prepared plant protoplasts, however, large molecules or particles may also reach the cell membrane and enter the cell by endocytosis, in which a patch of the membrane surrounds and forms a vesicle around the material to be. The cell membrane is located on the outside of a cell. Cell membrane, also called plasma membrane, thin membrane that surrounds every living cell, delimiting the cell from the environment around it. Depending on the membrane’s location and role in the body, lipids can make up anywhere from 20 to 80 percent of the membrane, with the remainder being proteins. Cholesterol is also present, which contributes to the fluidity of the membrane, and there are various proteins embedded within the membrane that have a variety of functions.</p>

<p>Cell junctions (or intercellular bridges) are a class of cellular structures consisting of multiprotein complexes that provide contact or adhesion between neighboring cells or between a cell and the extracellular matrix in animals. This greater conductance is thought to be conferred by the cell membrane’s proteins. Plant cell membranes serve two major functions. They share many common features, such as a cell membrane, nucleus, mitochondria, golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, and more.

<p>They also maintain the paracellular barrier of epithelia and control paracellular transport.cell junctions are especially abundant in epithelial tissues. Essentially, the cell wall is a complex, highly organized structure that defines the shape of a plant cell (it's also found in bacteria, fungi, algae, and archaea). In addition to defining the shape of plant cells, a cell wall has a few other functions that include maintaining the structural integrity of a cell, acting as a line of defense against a variety of external factors as well as. Phototropin 1 (phot1) is a ser/thr photoreceptor kinase that binds two molecules of flavin mononucleotide as its chromophores and undergoes autophosphorylation in response to blue light.

<p>While lipids help to give membranes their flexibility, proteins monitor and maintain the cell's chemical climate and assist in the transfer of molecules across the membrane. The plant cytoskeleton may have a role in defining contact sites between the plasma membrane and cell wall as it is clear that both actin and tubulin play essential roles in plant morphogenesis (kost et al., 1999). Think of a battery or a power plant in a town. In plant cells, because of the cell wall, only small molecules reach the cell membrane. The cell wall is present only in plants, fungi and bacteria.</p>

<p>Biophysicists measuring the electric current passing through cell membranes have found that, in general, cell membranes have a vastly greater electrical conductance than does a membrane bilayer composed only of phospholipids and sterols. In bacterial and plant cells, a cell wall is attached to the plasma membrane on its outside surface. It is present outside the cell membrane and is tough, flexible and sometimes rigid in its texture.
