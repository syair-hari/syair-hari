<p>The cell membrane is the semipermeable membrane of a cell that surrounds and encloses its contents of cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. Cell membrane is a protective covering that acts as a barrier between the inner and outer environment of a cell (in animals). The study of cells is called cell biology, cellular biology, or cytology. While the plant cell resembles rectangular shape and possesses a rigid cell wall. A thin semipermeable membrane layer of protein and fats surrounding the cell.</p>

<p>It is a selectively permeable cell organelle,allowing certain substances inside the cell while preventing others to pass through and thus is analogous to a barrier or gatekeeper in their function. The cells are composed of many or one cells that perform their individual functions. This is the rigid outermost layer of a plant cell. In plant cells, the membrane encapsulates the protoplasm. Plasma membrane they have a plasma membrane that is a thin flexible membrane, which acts as a protective covering for the animal cell.</p>

<p>As is the case with animal cells, the cell membrane in plants is a lipid bilayer. It is a double membranous structure composed of phospholipids. The cells are composed of many or one cells that perform their individual functions. Plant cells can move water across their membranes through a process called osmosis. The cell membrane is the boundary that separates the inside of the cell from the outside of the cell.</p>

<p>Like plant and fungi cells, an animal cell is eukaryotic, but animal cells lack the cell wall structure found in plant. The plant cell can also be larger than the animal cell. The ability to develop and grow The cell membrane also serves as an anchor point for the cytoskeleton of the cell in some organisms, and it attaches to the cell wall in plant cells. The cell membrane consists of a lipid bilayer, including cholesterols that sit between phospholipids to maintain their fluidity at various temperatures.</p>

<p>In both animal and plant cell. Here, the cell membrane is involved in a number of functions including containing cell organelles, transportation of molecules in and out of the cell as well as cell communication. The cell is surrounded by a membrane called the cell membrane. Animal cells may be different sizes and shapes and may carry out a wide range of actions that tend to be specialized depending on the type of animal cell. An animal cell is a type of cell that differs from plant or fungi cells.</p>

<p>More about animal ce ll : The cell wall is, a rigid membrane matrix found on the surface of all plant cells whose primary role is to protect the cell and its content. The cell membrane, also known as the plasma membrane, is a double layer of lipids and proteins that surrounds a cell.it separates the cytoplasm (the contents of the cell) from the external environment. All cells are surrounded by a cell membrane (also called a plasma membrane). The cell membrane also helps regulate the growth of the cell, by controlling the processes of exocytosis and endocytosis.</p>
